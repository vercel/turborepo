export const REPRODUCTION_REQUEST = `Thanks for opening this issue!

To help us investigate, could you provide a **minimal reproduction**? This is a simplified example that demonstrates the problem in isolation.

**A good reproduction is:**
- A public GitHub repository with the minimum amount of code to reproduce the issue
- Clear steps to follow (e.g., "run \`turbo build\`, observe error")
- Free of unrelated dependencies, environment variables, or configuration

You can use \`npx create-turbo@latest -e with-shell-commands\` to quickly scaffold a fresh monorepo:

Without a reproduction, we may not be able to investigate this issue.

Thank you!`;
