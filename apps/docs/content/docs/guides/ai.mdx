Turborepo is designed to work seamlessly with AI coding assistants. Turborepo provides features that help AI understand your repository and work more efficiently.

## Agent Skill

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) are an open standard that give new capabilities and expertise to agents. They're folders of instructions, scripts, and resources that agents can use to do things more accurately and efficiently.

You can add the Turborepo Skill to your agent, making it an expert in Turborepo and monorepos:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx skills add vercel/turborepo
```

The Skill teaches agents:

- Best practices for Turborepo configuration
- Monorepo patterns and conventions
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Performance optimization techniques

## Git worktrees for parallel agents

When running multiple AI agents in parallel on the same repository, [Git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree) prevent conflicts by allowing each agent to work in its own directory while sharing Git history.

Turborepo automatically shares the local cache across worktrees, so agents benefit from each other's cached task results:

```bash title="Terminal"
# Agent 1 creates a cache
turbo run build

# Create a worktree for Agent 2
git branch feature-branch && git worktree add ../agent-2-worktree feature-branch

# Agent 2 gets a cache hit from Agent 1's work
cd ../agent-2-worktree && turbo run build
```

Combined with [Remote Caching](/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching), this enables fast feedback loops across multiple agents working simultaneously.

## Task descriptions

Add a `description` field to your task definitions in `turbo.json` to help AI tools understand what each task does:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "description": "Compiles TypeScript and bundles the application",
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "description": "Runs the test suite with coverage",
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "description": "Checks code style and catches common errors"
    }
  }
}
```

Descriptions help AI assistants:

- **Understand your repository**: AI can quickly grasp what each task does without reading implementation details
- **Make better suggestions**: With context about task purposes, AI can provide more relevant recommendations
- **Onboard faster**: New team members (human or AI) can understand your build system at a glance

## Searching documentation

The `turbo docs` command lets you search the Turborepo documentation directly from your terminal:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo docs "package configurations"
```

Results link to versioned documentation matching your installed version of `turbo`, ensuring you get accurate information for your setup.

This is particularly useful when working with AI assistants that can execute shell commands. Instead of searching the web, you can get precise documentation links directly.

## Machine-readable documentation

Turborepo's documentation site is optimized for AI consumption in several ways:

### Markdown responses

When fetching documentation with appropriate headers, the site returns Markdown instead of HTML, preserving your AI's context window:

```bash title="Terminal"
curl -sL -H "Accept: text/markdown" https://turborepo.dev/docs
```

### Direct Markdown routes

Append `.md` to any documentation URL to get a Markdown version:

- `https://turborepo.dev/docs.md`
- `https://turborepo.dev/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching.md`

### Machine-readable sitemap

A sitemap is available at `https://turborepo.dev/sitemap.md`, allowing agents to discover what documentation exists.

### Versioned documentation

Documentation for specific Turborepo versions is available on subdomains. For example, the 2.7.6 documentation is at `https://v2-7-6.turborepo.dev/docs`.

This is useful when your AI needs to reference documentation matching your exact Turborepo version.
