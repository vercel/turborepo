# Diagram Examples

These are example diagrams using the mermaid syntax, rendered by our custom reactflow-based components.

## Flowcharts

### Simple left-to-right

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Install] --> B[Build] --> C[Test] --> D[Deploy]
```

### Top-down with labels

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[Source Code] --> B{Tests Pass?}
  B --> |Yes| C[Build Artifacts]
  B --> |No| D[Fix Tests]
  D --> A
  C --> E[Deploy to Staging]
  E --> F{QA Approved?}
  F --> |Yes| G[Deploy to Production]
  F --> |No| D
```

### Node shapes

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[Rectangle] --> B(Rounded)
  B --> C((Circle))
  C --> D{Diamond}
  D --> E([Stadium])
  E --> F[[Subroutine]]
```

### Subgraphs

```mermaid
graph TD
  subgraph ci [CI Pipeline]
    A[Lint] --> B[Test]
    B --> C[Build]
  end
  subgraph cd [CD Pipeline]
    D[Stage] --> E[Canary]
    E --> F[Production]
  end
  C --> D
```

### Turbo task graph

```mermaid
graph LR
  A[web#build] --> B[ui#build]
  A --> C[utils#build]
  B --> C
  D[docs#build] --> C
  D --> E[config#build]
```

## Sequence Diagrams

### Basic request/response

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant C as Client
  participant S as Server
  participant DB as Database
  C->>S: GET /api/users
  S->>DB: SELECT * FROM users
  DB-->>S: Results
  S-->>C: 200 OK (JSON)
```

### With notes and loops

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Dev as Developer
  participant Turbo as Turborepo
  participant Cache as Remote Cache
  Dev->>Turbo: turbo run build
  Turbo->>Cache: Check cache for hash
  alt Cache hit
    Cache-->>Turbo: Cached artifacts
    Note over Turbo: Replays output from cache
    Turbo-->>Dev: Build complete (cached)
  else Cache miss
    Cache-->>Turbo: Not found
    Note over Turbo: Executes task
    Turbo->>Cache: Upload artifacts
    Turbo-->>Dev: Build complete
  end
```

### Authentication flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant App as Application
  participant Auth as Auth Service
  participant API as API Server
  U->>App: Click Login
  App->>Auth: Redirect to /authorize
  Auth-->>U: Show login form
  U->>Auth: Submit credentials
  Auth-->>App: Authorization code
  App->>Auth: Exchange code for token
  Auth-->>App: Access token + Refresh token
  App->>API: Request with Bearer token
  API-->>App: Protected resource
  App-->>U: Display data
```
