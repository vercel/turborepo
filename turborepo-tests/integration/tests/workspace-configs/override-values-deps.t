# The override-values-task-with-deps configures dependsOn in the root turbo.json.
# The workspace does not have a turbo.json config. This test checks that both regular dependencies
# and Topological dependencies are retained from the root config.

# Run override-values-task-with-deps. In the root turbo.json it has two dependsOn values
# but in the workspace, we override to dependsOn: []. This test validates that only the
# top level task "override-values-task-with-deps" should run. None of the dependencies should run.
