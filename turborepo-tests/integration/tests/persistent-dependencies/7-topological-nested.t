# - app-a depends on pkg-a

# That means:

# Note: This error is interesting because pka-b doesn't implement a dev task, so saying that pkg-a
# shouldn't depend on it is weird. This is partly unavoidable, but partly debatable about what the
# error message should say. Leaving as-is so we don't have to implement special casing logic to handle
# this case.
