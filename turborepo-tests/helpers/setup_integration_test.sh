# Undo the set -eo pipefail at the top of this script
# This script is called with a leading ".", which means that it does not run
# in a new child process, so the set -eo pipefail would affect the calling script.
# Some of our tests actually assert non-zero exit codes, and we don't want to
# abort the test in those cases. So we undo the set -eo pipefail here.
