Faster compile times via parallelization\n2. Clean module boundaries with well-defined public APIs\n3. Enable independent development of subsystems\n4. Testability via dependency injection\n\nPrinciples:\n- One PR per extraction\n- Traits defined at consumer boundary (Dependency Inversion)\n- Pragmatic shared abstractions (extract when 3+ uses)\n- Each PR leaves codebase in working state","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-24T04:25:31.382Z","updated_at":"2025-12-24T04:25:31.382Z","dependencies":[],"labels":[],"comments":[]}
