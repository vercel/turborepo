Turbopack supports [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) out of the box. This means you can import `.ts` files with Turbopack. We support all of TypeScript's feature set.

Thanks to our JSX support, you can also import `.tsx` files too.

## Resolving `paths` and `baseUrl`

In TypeScript, you can use the [`paths`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#paths) property of `tsconfig.json` to let you import files from custom paths.

```json title="tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
        "app/*": ["app/*"],
        "config/*": ["app/_config/*"],
        "shared/*": ["app/_shared/*"],
    },
  }
}
```

This would let you import directly from `app/*` without needing to do a relative import:

```diff title="src/app/some/deep/file/in/your/app.ts"
- import { add } from '../../../../../math';
+ import { add } from 'app/math';

add();
```

Turbopack reads the `paths` and `baseUrl` in `tsconfig.json` in order to resolve these paths, just like `Next.js` does.

This means you only need to configure your absolute paths in one place.

## Type Checking

Turbopack does not perform type checks on your application. We use [SWC](https://swc.rs/) to compile TypeScript code, which also does not perform type checks.

This means that in order to run your type checks, you'll need a sidecar process running `tsc --watch`. Or, you can rely on your IDE's TypeScript integration.
