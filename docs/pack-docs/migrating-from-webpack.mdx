import { Callout } from '#/components/callout';

We're planning Turbopack as the successor to webpack. In the future, we plan to give Turbopack all the tools needed to support your webpack app.

## webpack loaders and resolve aliases

For apps running Next.js 13.2 or later, Turbopack supports configuration familiar to webpack users, including support for webpack loaders and customizing resolution rules.
Visit the [webpack loaders page in the Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/turbo#webpack-loaders) for how to configure Turbopack with these options.

Note that using webpack-based Next.js plugins as-is from `next.config.js` is **not yet supported**.

## FAQ

### Will it be compatible with webpack's API?

webpack has a huge API. It's extremely flexible and extensible, which is a big reason why it's so popular.

We're planning on making Turbopack very flexible and extensible, but we're **not planning 1:1 compatibility with webpack**. This lets us make choices which improve on webpack's API, and lets us optimize for speed and efficiency.

### Will we be able to use webpack plugins?

webpack plugins are a crucial part of webpack's ecosystem. They let you customize your toolchain, giving you low-level tools to maximize your productivity.

Unlike loaders, webpack plugins can be tightly integrated with webpack's internals.

Since we're not offering 1:1 API compatibility for plugins, most won't work out of the box with Turbopack. However, we're working on porting several of the most popular webpack plugins to Turbopack.
