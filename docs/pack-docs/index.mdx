Turbopack is an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust by the creators of webpack and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

The secret to Turbopack's performance is twofold: highly optimized machine code and a low-level incremental computation engine that enables caching down to the level of individual functions. Once Turbopack performs a task it never does it again.

Our team has taken the lessons from 10 years of webpack, combined with the innovations in incremental computation from [Turborepo](/repo) and Google's Bazel, and created an architecture ready to support the coming decades of computing.

<Callout type="info">
    Turbopack is currently in <strong>beta</strong> in the Next.js development server. You can try out Turbopack today by adding the `--turbo` flag to your `next dev` command.

    To report an issue, please use [the issue template in the Next.js repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=template%3A+bug&projects=&template=1.bug_report.yml). We appreciate your feedback.

    Note: Production builds with `next build` are not yet supported.

## Quickstart

As of today, Turbopack can be used in Next.js 14. In the future, we will be releasing a standalone CLI, plugin API, and support for other frameworks such as Svelte and Vue. For now, please follow these instructions to get started:

### New Projects

1. Create a Next.js 14 project with Turbopack:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-next-app --example with-turbopack
```

2. Start the Next.js development server (with Turbopack):

{' '}

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dev
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dev
```

  </Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

The Next.js 14 development server is now powered by Turbopack! Startup and updates should both be near-instant. The larger the application, the larger the improvement will be.

### Existing Projects

Add `--turbo` to your `next dev` command:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev --turbo"
  }
}
```
