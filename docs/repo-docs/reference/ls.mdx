List packages in your monorepo.

turbo ls [package(s)] [flags]
```

When scoped to the entire repository, output includes package manager, package count, and all package names and directories.

```bash title="Terminal"
# List all packages in the repository
turbo ls
```

When scoped to one or more packages, output includes package name, directory, internal dependencies, and all tasks.

```bash title="Terminal"
# List only two packages
turbo ls web @repo/ui [package(s)]
```

## Flags

### `--affected`

By default the changes considered are those between `main` and `HEAD`.

- You can override `main` as the default base by setting `TURBO_SCM_BASE`.
- You can override `HEAD` as the default head by setting `TURBO_SCM_HEAD`.

```bash title="Terminal"
TURBO_SCM_BASE=development turbo ls --affected
```

### `--output <format>` <ExperimentalBadge />

Format to output the results. `json` or `pretty` (default)

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo ls --output=json
```
