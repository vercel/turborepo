import { Heading } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/heading';

By setting certain environment variables, you can change Turborepo's behavior. This can be useful for creating specific configurations for different environments and machines.

System environment variables are always overridden by flag values provided directly to your `turbo` commands.

| Variable                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TURBO_API`                                       | Set the base URL for [Remote Cache](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching).                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `TURBO_BINARY_PATH`                               | Manually set the path to the `turbo` binary. By default, `turbo` will automatically discover the binary so you should only use this in rare circumstances.                                                                                              |
| `TURBO_CACHE_DIR`                                 | Sets the cache directory, similar to using [`--cache-dir`](/repo/docs/reference/run#--cache-dir-path) flag                                                                                                                                              |
| `TURBO_CI_VENDOR_ENV_KEY`                         | Set a prefix for environment variables that you want **excluded** from [Framework Inference](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#framework-inference).                                                                      |
| `TURBO_DANGEROUSLY_DISABLE_PACKAGE_MANAGER_CHECK` | Disable checking the `packageManager` field in `package.json`. You may run into [errors and unexpected caching behavior](/repo/docs/reference/run#--dangerously-disable-package-manager-check) when disabling this check. Use `true` or `1` to disable. |
| `TURBO_DOWNLOAD_LOCAL_ENABLED`                    | Enables global `turbo` to install the correct local version if one is not found.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `TURBO_FORCE`                                     | Always force all tasks to run in full, opting out of all caching.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `TURBO_GLOBAL_WARNING_DISABLED`                   | Disable warning when global `turbo` cannot find a local version to use.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `TURBO_PRINT_VERSION_DISABLED`                    | Disable printing the version of `turbo` that is being executed.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `TURBO_LOG_ORDER`                                 | Set the [log order](/repo/docs/reference/run#--log-order-option). Allowed values are `grouped` and `default`.                                                                                                                                           |

| `TURBO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`                        | Remove the update notifier that appears when a new version of `turbo` is available. You can also use `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` per ecosystem convention.                                                                                                     |
| `TURBO_PREFLIGHT`                                 | Enables sending a preflight request before every cache artifact and analytics request. The follow-up upload and download will follow redirects.

| `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_TIMEOUT`                      | Set a timeout in seconds for `turbo` to get artifacts from [Remote Cache](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching).                                                                                                                                     |

## Environment variables in tasks

Turborepo will make the following environment variables available within your tasks while they are executing:

| Variable       | Description                                                                                  |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
