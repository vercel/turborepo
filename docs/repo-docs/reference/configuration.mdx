Configure the behavior of `turbo` by adding a `turbo.json` file in your Workspace's root directory.

<Callout type="info">
  Changing your root `turbo.json` file will invalidate the cache for all tasks
  because it's considered in [the global
  hash](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching#global-hash-inputs). If
  you'd like the flexibility to change configuration without impacting the
  global hash, use [Package
  Configurations](/repo/docs/reference/package-configurations).
</Callout>

## Global Options

Impact all tasks and workspaces.

### `globalDependencies`

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "globalDependencies": [".env", "tsconfig.json"]
}
```

A list of globs that you want to include in all task hashes. **If any file matching these globs changes, all tasks will miss cache.** Globs are relative to the location of `turbo.json`.

By default, all files in source control in the Workspace root are included in the global hash.

<Callout type="error">
  Globs must be in the repository's source control root. Globs outside of the
  repository aren't supported.
</Callout>

### `globalEnv`

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "globalEnv": ["GITHUB_TOKEN", "PACKAGE_VERSION", "NODE_ENV"]
}
```

A list of environment variables that you want to make available.
Any change to these environment variables will cause all tasks to miss cache.

For more on wildcard and negation syntax, [see the `env` section](#env).

#### `globalPassThroughEnv`

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "globalPassThroughEnv": ["AWS_SECRET_KEY", "GITHUB_TOKEN"]
}
```

Similar to `globalEnv` but won't impact the hash of all tasks.
Changes to these environment variables will **not** cause the tasks to miss cache.

Using this key opts all tasks into [Strict Environment Variable Mode](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#strict-mode).

For more on wildcard and negation syntax, [see the `env` section](#env).

<Callout type="good-to-know">
  Turborepo has a built-in set of global passthrough variables for common cases,
  like operating system environment variables. This includes variables like
  `HOME`, `PATH`, `APPDATA`, `SHELL`, `PWD`, and more.
  
  The full list can be found [in the source code](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/crates/turborepo-lib/src/task_hash.rs).
</Callout>

### `ui`

Select a terminal UI for the repository, default to `stream`.

#### Stream

The output from different tasks is streamed to your terminal.
Outputs logs as they come in and is not interactive.

```json title="Terminal"
{
  "ui": "stream"
}
```

#### TUI

It allows for viewing each log at once and interacting with the task.

```json title="Terminal"
{
  "ui": "tui"
}
```

### `dangerouslyDisablePackageManagerCheck`

Default: `false`

Turborepo uses your repository's lockfile to determine caching behavior, [Package Graphs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages), and more. Because of this, we use [the `packageManager` field](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packagemanager) to help you stabilize your Turborepo.

To help with incremental migration or in situations where you can't use the `packageManager` field, you may use `--dangerously-disable-package-manager-check` to opt out of this check and assume the risks of unstable lockfiles producing unpredictable behavior. When disabled, Turborepo will attempt a best-effort discovery of the intended package manager meant for the repository.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "dangerouslyDisablePackageManagerCheck": true
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  You may also opt out of this check via
  [`flag`](/repo/docs/reference/run#--dangerously-disable-package-manager-check)
  or the [Environment
  Variable](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/reference/system-environment-variables)
  environment variable.
</Callout>

## Defining tasks

### `tasks`

Each key in the `tasks` object is the name of a task that can be executed by [`turbo run`](/repo/docs/reference/run). Turborepo will search the packages described in your [Workspace's configuration](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository#specifying-packages-in-a-monorepo) for scripts in `package.json` with the name of the task.

Using the rest of the configuration described in the task, Turborepo will run the scripts in the described order, caching logs and file outputs in [the `outputs` key](#outputs) when provided.

In the example below, we've defined three tasks under the `tasks` key: `build`, `test`, and `dev`.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"]
    },
    "test": {
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["build"]
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Task Options

Using the options available in the tasks you define in `tasks`, you can describe how `turbo` will run your tasks.

### `dependsOn`

A list of tasks that are required to complete before the task begins running.

There are three types of `dependsOn` relationships: [dependency relationships](#dependency-relationships), [same-package relationships](#same-package-relationships), and [arbitrary task relationships](#arbitrary-task-relationships).

#### Dependency Relationships

Prefixing a string in `dependsOn` with a `^` tells `turbo` that the task must wait for tasks in the package's dependencies to complete first. For example, in the `turbo.json` below:

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

`turbo` starts at the "bottom" of the package graph and recursively visits each package until it finds a package with no internal dependencies. It will then run the `build` task at the end of the dependency chain first, working its way back to the "top" until all `build` tasks are completed in order.

#### Same Package Relationships

Task names without the `^` prefix describe a task that depends on a different task within the same package. For example, in the `turbo.json` below:

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["lint", "build"]
    }
  }
}
```

The `test` task will only run after the `lint` and `build` tasks have completed **in the same package**.

#### Arbitrary Task Relationships

Specify a task dependency between specific package tasks.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "web#lint": {
      "dependsOn": ["utils#build"]
    }
  }
}
```

In this `turbo.json`, the `web#lint` task will wait for the `utils#build` task to complete.

### `env`

The list of environment variables a task depends on.
Any change to these environment variables will cause the task to miss cache.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["DATABASE_URL"]
    },
    "web#build": {
      "env": ["API_SERVICE_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### `passThroughEnv`

Similar to `env` but won't impact the hash of the task.
Changes to these environment variables will **not** cause the task to miss cache.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      // Values will available within `build` scripts
      "passThroughEnv": ["AWS_SECRET_KEY", "GITHUB_TOKEN"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="good-to-know">
  Turborepo automatically includes environment variables prefixed by common
  frameworks through [Framework
  Inference](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#framework-inference).
  For example, if your package is a Next.js project, you do not need to specify
  any environment variables that [start with
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables#exposing-environment-variables-to-the-browser).
</Callout>

#### Wildcards

Turborepo supports wildcards for environment variables so you can easily account for all environment variables with a given prefix. For example, the `turbo.json` below include all environment variables that start with `MY_API_` into the hash:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["MY_API_*"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Negation

A leading `!` means that the entire pattern will be negated. For instance, the `turbo.json` below will ignore the `MY_API_URL` variable.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["!MY_API_URL"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Examples

| Pattern    | Description                                                                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"*"`      | Matches every environment variable.                                            |
| `"!*"`     | Excludes every environment variable.                                           |
| `"FOO*"`   | Matches `FOO`, `FOOD`, `FOO_FIGHTERS`, etc.                                    |
| `"FOO\*"`  | Resolves to `"FOO*"` and matches `FOO`, `FOOD`, and `FOO_FIGHTERS`.            |
| `"FOO\\*"` | Matches a single environment variable named `FOO*`.                            |
| `"!FOO*"`  | Excludes all environment variables that start with `FOO`.                      |
| `"\!FOO"`  | Resolves to `"!FOO"`, and excludes a single environment variable named `!FOO`. |
| `"\\!FOO"` | Matches a single environment variable named `!FOO`.                            |
| `"FOO!"`   | Matches a single environment variable named `FOO!`.                            |

### `outputs`

A list of file glob patterns relative to the package's `package.json` to cache when the task is successfully completed.

Omitting this key or passing an empty array tells `turbo` to cache nothing (except logs, which are always cached when caching is enabled).

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      // Cache all files emitted to the packages's `dist` directory
      "outputs": ["dist/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `cache`

Default: `true`

Defines if task outputs should be cached. Setting `cache` to false is useful for long-running development tasks and ensuring that a task always runs when it is in the task's execution graph.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".svelte-kit/**", "dist/**"] // File outputs will be cached
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false, // No outputs will be cached
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

### `inputs`

Default: `[]`, all files in the package that are checked into source control

A list of file glob patterns relative to the package's `package.json` to consider when determining if a package has changed. `turbo.json` is **always** considered an input.

Visit the [file glob specification](/repo/docs/reference/globs) for more information on globbing syntax.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.ts", "src/**/*.tsx", "test/**/*.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="warn">
  Using the `inputs` key opts you out of `turbo`'s default behavior of
  considering `.gitignore`. You must reconstruct the globs from `.gitignore` as
  desired or use `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` to build off of the default behavior.
</Callout>

#### Inherit Default Behavior

Because specifying an `inputs` key immediately opts out of the default behavior, you may use
the special string `$TURBO_DEFAULT$` within the `inputs` array to restore `turbo`'s default behavior. This allows you to tweak the default behavior for more granularity.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "check-types": {
      // Consider all default inputs except the package's README
      "inputs": ["$TURBO_DEFAULT$", "!README.md"]
    }
  }
}
```

### `outputLogs`

Default: `full`

Set output logging verbosity. Can be overridden by the [`--output-logs`](/repo/docs/reference/run#--output-logs-option) CLI option.

| Option        | Description                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `full`        | Displays all logs                 |
| `hash-only`   | Only show the hashes of the tasks |
| `new-only`    | Only show logs from cache misses  |
| `errors-only` | Only show logs from task failures |
| `none`        | Hides all task logs               |

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputLogs": "new-only"
    }
  }
}
```

### `persistent`

Default: `false`

Label a task as `persistent` to prevent other tasks from depending on long-running processes. Persistent tasks are made [interactive](#interactive) by default.

Because a long-running process won't exit, tasks that would depend on it would never run. Once you've labeled the task as persistent, `turbo` will throw an error if other tasks depend on it.

This option is most useful for development servers or other "watch" tasks.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev": {
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

Tasks marked with `persistent` are also `interactive` by default.

### `interactive`

Default: `false` (Defaults to `true` for tasks marked as `persistent`)

Label a task as `interactive` to make it accept inputs from `stdin` in the terminal UI. Must be used with `persistent`.

This task is most useful for scripts that can be manipulated while they are running, like Jest or Vitest.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test:watch": {
      "interactive": true,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```
