Use `turbo` to determine of a package or its dependencies have changes. This can be useful for quickly skipping tasks in CI.

```bash title="Terminal"
npx turbo-ignore [workspace] [flags...]
```

## turbo-ignore versioning

Because `turbo-ignore` is most often used before installing dependencies into the repository, there won't be a `turbo` binary available when you run `turbo-ignore`. Instead `turbo-ignore` will search for the correct version to use with your repository with the following strategy:

- First, check for a `turbo` entry in root `package.json#devDependencies` or `package.json#dependencies`. If a version is found there, it will be used.
- If no `entry` is found in `package.json`, `turbo.json` will be read for its schema. If [the `tasks` key](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#tasks) is found, use `turbo@^2`. If the `pipeline` from Turborepo v1 is found, use `turbo@^1`.
