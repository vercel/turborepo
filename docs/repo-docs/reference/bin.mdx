Get the path to the `turbo` binary.

When using [**global `turbo`**](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), this will be the path to the global `turbo` binary. You're likely to see a path to the global directory of the package manager you used to install `turbo`.

When using [**local `turbo`**](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#repository-installation), this will be the path to the local `turbo` binary. When `turbo` is installed in your repository, it is likely to be a path to `node_modules`.
