description: Flags, configurations, and System Environment Variables for Turborepo
---

There are three ways to manage the behavior of `turbo run` or `turbo watch` invocations:

- Configuration in `turbo.json`
- System environment variables
- Flags passed to the CLI invocation

The three strategies listed above are in order of precedence. Where a flag value is provided, for the same System Environment Variable or `turbo.json` configuration, the value for the flag will be used. Because of this, we recommend using:

- `turbo.json` configuration for defaults
- System Environment Variables for per-environment overrides
- Flags for per-invocation overrides

Below is a table showing the various ways to options available for setting behaviors and where the strategies overlap.

## Options table

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Cache sources | [`--cache`](/repo/docs/reference/run#--cache-options) | `TURBO_CACHE`         | None       |
