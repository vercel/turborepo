## Acknowledgements

Turborepo was originally created by [Jared Palmer](https://x.com/jaredpalmer) as a closed-source enterprise software offering. In late 2021, [Vercel acquired Turborepo](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-turborepo) and open sourced the codebase.

Today, Turborepo has dedicated full-time team working on it as well as a growing list of [open source contributors](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/graphs/contributors).
