[Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) is an open source framework that makes web development intuitive and powerful.

## Quickstart

To get started with Nuxt in a Turborepo quickly, use [the `with-vue-nuxt` example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-vue-nuxt):

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-vue-nuxt
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-vue-nuxt
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest -e with-vue-nuxt
```

</Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Adding a Nuxt application to an existing repository

Use [Nuxi](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nuxi), Nuxt's CLI, to set up a new Nuxt application in a package. From the root of your repository, run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx nuxi@latest init apps/my-app
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx nuxi@latest init apps/my-app
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx nuxi@latest init apps/my-app
```

</Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

## Integrating with your repository

To add [Internal Packages](/repo/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages) to your new application, install them into the app with your package manager:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>

```diff title="./apps/my-app/package.json"
{
 "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
+   "@repo/ui": "*"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```diff title="./apps/my-app/package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
+   "@repo/ui": "*"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```diff title="./apps/my-app/package.json"
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
+   "@repo/ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

</Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Make sure to run your package manager's install command. You also may need to update `scripts` in `package.json` to fit your use case in your repository.

### Customizing tasks

By default, the new application will use the tasks defined in the root `turbo.json`. If you'd like to configure tasks differently for the new application, use [Package Configurations](/repo/docs/reference/package-configurations).
