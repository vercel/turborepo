description: Learn how to use CircleCI with Turborepo.

import { PackageManagerTabs, Tab } from '#/components/tabs';
import { Callout } from '#/components/callout';

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/).

<Callout type="warn" title="TTY on CircleCI">
  CircleCI [uses interactive terminals
  (TTY)](https://discuss.circleci.com/t/reprise-allow-for-using-circle-ci-tooling-without-a-tty/23309)
  that crash Turborepo's terminal UI. To workaround this, set the
  `TURBO_UI=false` environment variable in your CircleCI configuration.
</Callout>

For a given root `package.json`:

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "latest"
  }
}
```

And a `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**", "!.next/cache/**"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
  }
}
```

Create a file called `.circleci/config.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>

    ```yaml title=".circleci/config.yml"
    version: 2.1
    orbs:
      node: circleci/node@5.0.2
    workflows:
      test:
        jobs:
          - test
    jobs:
      test:
        docker:
          - image: cimg/node:lts
        steps:
          - checkout
          - node/install-packages
          - run:
            command: npm run build
            environment:
              TURBO_UI: "false"

          - run:
            command: npm run test
            environment:
              TURBO_UI: "false"
    ```

  </Tab>

            command: yarn build
            environment:
              TURBO_UI: "false"
          - run:
            command: yarn test
            environment:
              TURBO_UI: "false"
    ```

          - node/install-packages
          - run:
            command: npm i -g pnpm
            environment:

          - run:

            environment:

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching, retrieve the team and token for the Remote Cache for your provider. In this example, we'll use [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching):

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your CircleCI project settings and click on the **Environment Variables** tab. Create a new secret called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![CircleCI Create Environment Variables](/images/docs/circleci-create-environment-variables.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL _without_ the `vercel.com/`. Your Team URL can be found inside your team's general project settings from the dashboard.

   If you're using a Hobby Plan, you can use your username. Your username can be found in your [Vercel Personal Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account)

4. CircleCI automatically loads environment variables stored in project settings into the CI environment. No modifications are necessary for the CI file.
