[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) unlocks a new level of developer experience when working with databases thanks to its intuitive data model, automated migrations, type-safety & auto-completion.

[Their official guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/using-prisma-orm-with-turborepo#1-create-your-monorepo-using-turborepo) describes how to integrate Prisma into a Turborepo, including:

- Prisma client initialization
- Packaging the client as an [Internal Package](/repo/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages)
- Performing migrations
- Working on your applications locally
- Deploying

## Example

To get started with our community-supported Prisma example, run:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-prisma
```
