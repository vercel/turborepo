[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a test runner from the Vite ecosystem. Integrating it with Turborepo will lead to enormous speed-ups.

[The Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/workspace) shows how to create a "Vitest Workspace" that runs all tests in the monorepo from one root command, enabling behavior like merged coverage reports out-of-the-box. This feature doesn't follow modern best practices for monorepos, since its designed for compatibility with Jest (whose Workspace feature was built before [package manager Workspaces](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository)).

Because of this you have two options, each with their own tradeoffs:

- [Leveraging Turborepo for caching](#leveraging-turborepo-for-caching)
- [Using Vitest's Workspace feature](#using-vitests-workspace-feature)

### Leveraging Turborepo for caching

To improve on cache hit rates and only run tests with changes, you can choose to configure tasks per-package, splitting up the Vitest command into separate, cacheable scripts in each package. This speed comes with the tradeoff that you'll need to create merged coverage reports yourself.

<Callout>
  For a complete example, run `npx create-turbo@latest --example with-vitest` or
  [visit the example's source
  code](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-vitest).
</Callout>

#### Setting up

Let's say we have a simple [package manager Workspace](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository) that looks like this:

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Both `apps/web` and `packages/ui` have their own test suites, with `vitest` [installed into the packages that use them](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/managing-dependencies#install-dependencies-where-theyre-used). Their `package.json` files include a `test` script that runs Vitest:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "latest"
  }
}
```

Inside the root `turbo.json`, create a `test` task:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["transit"]
    },
    "transit": {
      "dependsOn": ["^transit"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, `turbo run test` can parallelize and cache all of the test suites from each package, only testing code that has changed.

#### Running tests in watch mode

When you run your test suite in CI, it logs results and eventually exits upon completion. This means you can [cache it with Turborepo](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching). But when you run your tests using Vitest's watch mode during development, the process never exits. This makes a watch task more like a [long-running, development task](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/developing-applications).

Because of this difference, we recommend specifying **two separate Turborepo tasks**: one for running your tests, and one for running them in watch mode.

<Callout>
  This strategy below creates two tasks, one for local development and one for
  CI. You could choose to make the `test` task for local development and create
  some `test:ci` task instead.
</Callout>

For example, inside the `package.json` file for each workspace:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

And, inside the root `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^test"]
    },
    "test:watch": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

You can now run your tasks using [global `turbo`](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) as `turbo run test:watch` or from a script in your root `package.json`:

<Tabs items={["Global turbo", "./package.json"]}>
<Tab value="Global turbo">

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo run test

turbo run test:watch
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="./package.json">

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "test:watch": "turbo run test:watch"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

#### Creating merged coverage reports

[Vitest's Workspace feature](#using-vitests-workspace-feature) creates an out-of-the-box coverage report that merges all of your packages' tests coverage reports. Following the Turborepo strategy, though, you'll have to merge the coverage reports yourself.

<Callout type="info">
  The [`with-vitest`
  example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-vitest)
  shows a complete example that you may adapt for your needs. You can get
  started with it quickly using `npx create-turbo@latest --example with-vitest`.
</Callout>

To do this, you'll follow a few general steps:

1. Run `turbo run test` to create the coverage reports.
2. Merge the coverage reports with [`nyc merge`](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc?tab=readme-ov-file#what-about-nyc-merge).
3. Create a report using `nyc report`.

Turborepo tasks to accomplish will look like:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^test", "@repo/vitest-config#build"],
      "outputs": ["coverage.json"]
    }
    "merge-json-reports": {
      "inputs": ["coverage/raw/**"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/merged/**"]
    },
    "report": {
      "dependsOn": ["merge-json-reports"],
      "inputs": ["coverage/merge"],
      "outputs": ["coverage/report/**"]
    },
  }
}
```

With this in place, run `turbo test && turbo report` to create a merged coverage report.

<Callout type="info">

  example](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples/with-vitest)
  shows a complete example that you may adapt for your needs. You can get

</Callout>

### Using Vitest's Workspace feature

The Vitest Workspace feature doesn't follow the same model as a [package manager Workspace](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository). Instead, it uses a root script that then reaches out into each package in the repository to handle the tests in that repsective package.

In this model, there aren't package boundaries, from a modern JavaScript ecosystem perspective. This means you can't rely on Turborepo's caching, since Turborepo leans on those package boundaries.

Because of this, you'll need to use [Root Tasks](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/configuring-tasks#registering-root-tasks) if you want to run the tests using Turborepo. Once you've configured [a Vitest Workspace](https://vitest.dev/guide/workspace), create the Root Tasks for Turborepo:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "//#test": {
      "outputs": ["coverage/**"]
    },
    "//#test:watch": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Notably, the file inputs for a Root Task include all packages by default, so any change in any package will result in a cache miss.** While this does make for a simplified configuration to create merged coverage reports, you'll be missing out on opportunities to cache repeated work.

### Using a hybrid approach

You can combine the benefits of both approaches by implementing a hybrid solution.This approach unifies local development using Vitest's Workspace approach while preserving Turborepo's caching in CI.  This comes at the tradeoff of slightly more configuration and a mixed task running model in the repository.

```ts title="./vitest.workspace.ts"
import { defineWorkspace } from 'vitest/config'

export default defineWorkspace([
  'packages/*',
])
```

In this setup, your packages maintain their individual Vitest configurations and scripts:

```json title="./packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

While your root `package.json` includes scripts for running tests globally:

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:workspace": "turbo run test",
    "test:workspace:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

This configuration allows developers to run `pnpm test:workspace:watch` at the root for a seamless local development experience, while CI continues to use `turbo run test` to leverage package-level caching. **You'll still need to handle merged coverage reports manually as described in the previous section**.
