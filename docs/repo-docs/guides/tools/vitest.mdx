[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a test runner from the Vite ecosystem. Integrating it with Turborepo will lead to enormous speed-ups.

<Callout>
  For information on how to set up Vitest in a monorepo, refer to [Vitest's
  Workspace guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/workspace). This guide will teach
  how to use Vitest with concepts from Turborepo.
</Callout>

## Setting up

Let's say we have a monorepo that looks like this:

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Both `apps/web` and `packages/ui` have their own test suites, with `vitest` [installed into the packages that use them](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/managing-dependencies#install-dependencies-where-theyre-used). Their `package.json` files include a `test` script that runs Vitest:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  }
}
```

Inside the root `turbo.json`, create a `test` task:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^test"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, `turbo test` can parallelize and cache all of the test suites from each package, only testing code that has changed.

## Running tests in watch mode

When you run your test suite in CI, it logs to `stdout` and eventually exits upon completion. This means you can [cache it](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching) with Turborepo.

But when you run your tests in a watched mode, the process never exits. This makes a watch task more like a [development task](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/developing-applications).

Because of this difference, we recommend specifying **two separate Turborepo tasks**: one for running your tests, and one for running them in watch mode.

<Callout>
  This strategy below creates two tasks, one for local development and one for
  CI. You could choose to make the `test` task for local development and create
  a `test:ci` task instead.
</Callout>

For example, inside your each `package.json` file for each workspace:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

Inside the root `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {},
    "test:watch": {
      "cache": false, // [!code highlight]
      "persistent": true // [!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```

You can now either run your tasks using [global `turbo`](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) as `turbo test:watch` or from a script in your root `package.json`:

<Tabs items={["Global turbo", "./package.json"]}>
<Tab value="Global turbo">

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo test
```

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo test:watch
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="./package.json">

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "test:watch": "turbo run test:watch"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

## Creating merged coverage reports

[The Vitest documentation](https://vitest.dev/guide/workspace#configuration) shows how to create merged coverage reports. Note Vitest's requirements for this don't follow some of our best practice monorepo recommendations, but we can still make this work.

Notably, the Vitest documentation recommends creating a configuration file in the root of the JavaScript Workspace. Because of this, there will be configuration outside of our packages that affects their behavior, so we have to account for it in hashing. We can do this by adding the `inputs` key to the task:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^test"],
      "inputs": [
        "$TURBO_DEFAULT$",
        "../vitest.workspace.ts",
        "../vitest.config.ts"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The `inputs` is doing two things to ensure caching is correct:

- Using [`$TURBO_DEFAULT$`](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#turbo_default) to ensure the package's default inputs continue to be used
- Adds the Vitest configuration files from the Workspace root to the hash to ensure cache is missed if these files change

Together, these inputs create the required caching behavior.
