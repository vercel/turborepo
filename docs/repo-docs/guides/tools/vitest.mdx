[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a test runner from the Vite ecosystem. Integrating it with Turborepo will lead to enormous speed-ups.

<Callout>
  For information on how to set up Vitest in a monorepo, refer to [Vitest's
  Workspace guide](https://vitest.dev/guide/workspace). This guide will teach
  how to use Vitest with concepts from Turborepo.
</Callout>

## Setting up

Let's say we have a monorepo that looks like this:

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="ui" defaultOpen>
      <File name="package.json" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Both `apps/web` and `packages/ui` have their own test suites, with `vitest` [installed into the packages that use them](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/managing-dependencies#install-dependencies-where-theyre-used). Their `package.json` files include a `test` script that runs Vitest:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "vitest": "latest"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run"
  }
}
```

Inside the root `turbo.json`, create a `test` task:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^test"]
    }
  }
}
```

Now, `turbo test` can parallelize and cache all of the test suites from each package, only testing code that has changed.

## Running tests in watch mode

When you run your test suite in CI, it logs to `stdout` and eventually exits upon completion. This means you can [cache it](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching) with Turborepo.

But when you run your tests in a watched mode, the process never exits. This makes a watch task more like a [development task](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/developing-applications).

Because of this difference, we recommend specifying **two separate Turborepo tasks**: one for running your tests, and one for running them in watch mode.

<Callout>
  This strategy below creates two tasks, one for local development and one for
  CI. You could choose to make the `test` task for local development and create
  a `test:ci` task instead.
</Callout>

For example, inside your each `package.json` file for each workspace:

```json title="./apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest run",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch"
  }
}
```

Inside the root `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "test": {},
    "test:watch": {
      "cache": false, // [!code highlight]
      "persistent": true // [!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```

You can now either run your tasks using [global `turbo`](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) as `turbo test:watch` or from a script in your root `package.json`:

<Tabs items={["Global turbo", "./package.json"]}>
<Tab value="Global turbo">

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo test
```

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo test:watch
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="./package.json">

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "turbo run test",
    "test:watch": "turbo run test:watch"
  }
}
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>
