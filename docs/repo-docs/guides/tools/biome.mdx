[Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) is a fast formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON that saves CI and developer time.

## Using Biome with Turborepo

Biome is a rare exception to most tools that are used with Turborepo because it is **so extraordinarily fast**. For this reason, we recommend using a [Root Task](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/configuring-tasks#registering-root-tasks) rather than creating separate scripts in each of your packages.

<Callout type="info" title="Caching behavior">
  Using Biome at the root of the project will result in cache misses for all
  tasks when you upgrade Biome versions or change configuration. If you prefer
  the tradeoff of higher cache hit ratios in these situations over less
  configuration, you can still use Biome in separate scripts like the other
  recommendations in our guides.
</Callout>

### Initialize Biome

First, [follow the installation documentation to set up Biome](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/) in your repository. You'll then be able to create a script to use Biome in the root of your repository:

```json title="./package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "format-and-lint": "biome check .",
    "format-and-lint:fix": "biome check . --write"
  }
}
```

### Create a root task

In practice, Biome is unlikely to be a bottleneck in the iteration speed of your repository. For this reason, we can have less configuration to manage in our repository by using Biome in a [Root Task](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/configuring-tasks#registering-root-tasks).

<Callout type="info">
  If you believe Biome may be faster in your repository split up into tasks in
  packages, you are free to do so. We encourage you to experiment with what's
  best for your use case.
</Callout>

To create a Root Task, register the scripts to Turborepo:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "//#format-and-lint": {},
    "//#format-and-lint:fix": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

You'll now be able to run these scripts using `turbo run format-and-lint` and `turbo run format-and-lint:fix`.
