Turborepo includes tools for understanding your repository structure, that can help you use and optimize your codebase.

## `turbo ls`

To list your packages, you can run `turbo ls`. This will show the packages in your repository and where they're located.

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo ls
turbo 2.1.3

 WARNING  ls command is experimental and may change in the future
5 packages (pnpm9)

  @repo/eslint-config packages/eslint-config
  @repo/typescript-config packages/typescript-config
  @repo/ui packages/ui
  docs apps/docs
  web apps/web
```

You can [apply filters](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters) to `ls`, just like `run`:

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo ls --filter ...ui
3 packages (pnpm9)

  @repo/ui packages/ui
  docs apps/docs
  web apps/web
```

## `turbo run`

To determine which tasks can be run in your monorepo, simply call `turbo run` without any tasks. You will get a list of
tasks and the packages in which they are defined:

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo run
No tasks provided, here are some potential ones to run

  lint
    @repo/ui, docs, web
  build
    docs, web
  dev
    docs, web
  start
    docs, web
  generate:component
    @repo/ui
```

## `turbo query`

If you wish to dig into your repository structure, since `2.2.0`, Turbo provides a GraphQL interface into your repository
via `turbo query`. You can execute queries such as finding all packages that have a `test` task:

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo query "query { packages(filter: { has: { field: TASK_NAME, value: \"build\"}}) { items { name } } }"
{
  "data": {
    "packages": {
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "//"
        },
        {
          "name": "docs"
        },
        {
          "name": "web"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

This can be helpful for diagnosing potential problems in your package or task dependency graph. For instance, let's say
you're getting a lot of cache misses in your builds. This could be because there's a package that keeps getting changed
and is imported throughout your codebase.

To do this, we can run a query to find packages that are directly imported more than 10 times in your monorepo:

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo query "query { packages(filter: { greaterThan: { field: DIRECT_DEPENDENT_COUNT, value: 10 } }) { items { name } } }"
{
  "data": {
    "packages": {
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "utils"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Now that we've found this package, we can try to split it up into smaller packages so that a small change won't
invalidate the whole dependency graph.

Or let's say you're using our new `--affected` flag, but you're still running more tasks than you'd like.
With `turbo query`, you can find all the packages and the reason why they were invalidated:

```bash title="Terminal"
> turbo query "query { affectedPackages(base: \"HEAD^\", head: \"HEAD\") { items { reason {  __typename } } } }"
{
  "data": {
    "affectedPackages": {
      "items": [
        {
          "name": "utils",
          "reason": {
            "__typename": "FileChanged"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "web",
          "reason": {
            "__typename": "DependencyChanged"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "docs",
          "reason": {
            "__typename": "DependencyChanged"
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "cli",
          "reason": {
            "__typename": "DependencyChanged"
          }
        },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
