Turborepo's [task cache](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/caching) saves time by never doing the same work twice.

But there's a problem: **the cache is local to your machine**. When you're working with a Continuous Integration system, this can result in a lot of duplicated work:

<ThemeAwareImage
  dark={{
    alt: 'Local caching creates a cache on each system.',
    src: '/images/docs/local-caching-dark.png',
    props: {
      width: 896,
      height: 345,
    },
  }}
  light={{
    alt: 'Local caching creates a cache on each system.',
    src: '/images/docs/local-caching-light.png',
    props: {
      width: 896,
      height: 345,
    },
  }}
/>

Since Turborepo only caches to the local filesystem by default, the same task (`turbo run build`) must be **re-executed on each machine** (by you, by your teammates, by your CI, by your PaaS, etc.) even when all of the task inputs are identical â€” which **wastes time and resources**.

<Callout type="good-to-know">
  You don't have to use Remote Caching to use Turborepo. While Remote Caching
  will bring the most significant speedups, you can make your existing workflows
  faster without Remote Caching, too.
</Callout>

## A single, shared cache

What if you could share a single Turborepo cache across your entire team (and even your CI)?

<ThemeAwareImage
  dark={{
    alt: 'Remote caching creates a shared cache for your entire team.',
    src: '/images/docs/remote-caching-dark.png',
    props: {
      width: 896,
      height: 489,
    },
  }}
  light={{
    alt: 'Remote caching creates a shared cache for your entire team.',
    src: '/images/docs/remote-caching-light.png',
    props: {
      width: 896,
      height: 489,
    },
  }}
/>

By working with providers like [Vercel](#vercel), Turborepo can securely communicate with a remote cache - a cloud server that stores the results of your tasks.

This can save enormous amounts of time by **preventing duplicated work across your entire organization**.

<Callout>
  Remote Caching is a powerful feature of Turborepo, but, with great power,
  comes great responsibility. Make sure you are caching correctly first and
  double check [handling of environment
  variables](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables).
  Please also remember Turborepo treats logs as artifacts, so be aware of what
  you are printing to the console.

### For Local Development

To link your local Turborepo to your Remote Cache, authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo login
```

You can also use your package manager if you do not have [global `turbo`](/repo/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed:

<PackageManagerTabs>
<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
npx turbo login
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
yarn dlx turbo login
```

</Tab>

<Tab>

```bash title="Terminal"
pnpm dlx turbo login
```

</Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

<Callout>
  If your Remote Cache is configured to use single-sign-on you will need to run
  `npx turbo login --sso-team=team-name` in order to get a cache token with the
  correct privileges.
</Callout>

Now, link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo link
```

Once enabled, make some changes to a package you are currently caching and run tasks against it with `turbo run`.
Your cache artifacts will now be stored locally _and_ in your Remote Cache.

To verify, delete your local Turborepo cache with:

<PlatformTabs>
  <Tab>

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    rm -rf ./.turbo/cache
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    ```bash title="Terminal"
    rd /s /q "./.turbo/cache"
    ```

  </Tab>
</PlatformTabs>

Then, run the same build again. If things are working properly, `turbo` should not execute tasks locally. Instead, it will download the logs and artifacts from your Remote Cache and replay them back to you.

### Remote Caching on Vercel

If you are building and hosting your apps on Vercel, Remote Caching will be automatically set up on your behalf once you use `turbo`. Refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching?utm_source=turbo.build&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link) for more information.

### Artifact Integrity and Authenticity Verification

Turborepo can sign artifacts with a secret key before uploading them to the Remote Cache. Turborepo uses `HMAC-SHA256` signatures on artifacts using a secret key you provide.
Turborepo will verify the Remote Cache artifacts' integrity and authenticity when they're downloaded.
Any artifacts that fail to verify will be ignored and treated as a cache miss by Turborepo.

To enable this feature, set the `remoteCache` options on your `turbo.json` config to include `signature: true`. Then specify your secret key by declaring the `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` environment variable.

```jsonc title="./turbo.json"
{
  "remoteCache": {
    "signature": true // [!code highlight]
  }
}
```

## Remote Cache API

A Remote Cache can be implemented by any HTTP server that meets Turborepo's Remote Caching API specification.

### Managed Remote Cache with Vercel

[Vercel](https://vercel.com), the creators and maintainers of Turborepo, provide a managed Remote Cache that is fully compatible with Turborepo.

Using [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching) is zero-configuration and automatically integrates with [Vercel deployments](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) through the open-source [Vercel Remote Cache SDK](https://github.com/vercel/remote-cache).

Learn more about [Turborepo on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/turborepo) or [deploy a template for free](https://vercel.com/templates?search=turborepo) to try it out.

### Self-hosting

You can also self-host your own Remote Cache and set the remote caching domain by specifying the `--api` and `--token` flags, where `--api` is the hostname and `--token` is a bearer token.

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo login --api="https://my-server.example.com/api"
turbo link --api="https://my-server-example.com"
turbo run build --api="https://my-server.example.com" --token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

You can [find the OpenAPI specification for the API here](/api/remote-cache-spec). At this time, all versions of `turbo` are compatible with the `v8` endpoints.
