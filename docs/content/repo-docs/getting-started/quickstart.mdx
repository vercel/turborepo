import { ExamplesTable } from "#/components/ExamplesTable";

To get started with Turborepo in a few moments, you can quickly scaffold a starter monorepo using:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The starter has two deployable applications and three shared libraries for use in the rest of the monorepo. For more details on the starter, [visit the README for the basic starter on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/basic).

## Starting with an example

Additionally, the community curates a set of examples to showcase ways to use common tools and libraries with Turborepo. To bootstrap your monorepo with one of the examples, use the same command as above with the `--example` flag:

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
<Tab value="npm">
```bash
npx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="yarn">
```bash
yarn dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="pnpm">
```bash
pnpm dlx create-turbo@latest --example $(example-name)
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

Use any of the example's names below:
