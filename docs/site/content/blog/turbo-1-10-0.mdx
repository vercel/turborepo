Turborepo 1.10 introduces new features to improve your local development experience:

- [**Code Generators**](#code-generators): Use `turbo gen` to generate source code, including creating new workspaces and copying existing ones.
- [**Improved Environment Variable Inputs**](#improved-environment-variable-inputs): It's now easier to depend on environment variables with wildcards and `.env` support.
- [**New Environment Modes**](#environment-modes): You can now specify `--env-mode=strict` to control environment variables that are included in your task hashes.

Update today with

```bash title="Terminal"
npx @turbo/codemod migrate
```

Turborepo Generators allow you to add new code to your repository in a predictable, structured way.
Previously, you would need to copy code yourself and manually add dependencies to your new workspace. With Generators,
we've automated the process of creating new workspaces and integrating them into your repository.

You can [create a blank workspace from scratch](/repo/docs/guides/generating-code#add-an-empty-workspace), [copy an existing workspace](/repo/docs/guides/generating-code#copy-an-existing-workspace), or even create custom generators
for more control. Custom generators leverage [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) configurations, a common template definition strategy used in the JavaScript ecosystem.

[Custom generators](/repo/docs/guides/generating-code#custom-generators) can also be used to scaffold more granular sets of code than workspaces. You can significantly speed up tasks like:

- [Adding new components to your UI library](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/examples/basic/packages/ui/turbo/generators/config.ts)
- Creating new unit tests
- Generating a new MDX blog post

Get started with your first generator by running:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo gen
```

## Improved Environment Variable Inputs

### Support for `.env` files

[`.env` files](https://www.dotenv.org/docs/) are commonly used to load environment variables. This can cause problems when running with `turbo`, because these variables can be [invisible](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#avoid-creating-or-mutating-environment-variables-at-runtime), and are not easily
included in the hash for your task. This problem could cause unintended cache hits while working locally.

Turborepo now makes this much easier with automatic support for `.env` files.

To ensure that Turborepo includes these variables in your hash, use the `dotEnv` key. For example, here is a configuration for a Next.js application:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "globalDotEnv": [".env"],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dotEnv": [
        ".env.production.local",
        ".env.local",
        ".env.production",
        ".env"
      ]
    },
    "dev": {
      "dotEnv": [
        ".env.development.local",
        ".env.local",
        ".env.development",
        ".env"
      ]
    },
    "test": {
      "dotEnv": [".env.test.local", ".env.test", ".env"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout>
  This feature does **not** handle system environment variables. If you are not
  using `.env` files outside of development, make sure your environment
  variables are still enumerated in either
  [env](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#env), or
  [globalEnv](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#globalenv) to ensure they are
  included in your hash.
</Callout>

For more, check out the [documentation](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#dotenv).

### Environment Variable Wildcards

Large applications can end up with many environment variables in their `turbo.json`. This can make your configuration difficult to manage and maintain.

With wildcards, you can now specify patterns of variables to include in your hash.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://turbo.build/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["ACME_*"]
    }
  }
}
```

For more, check out the [documentation](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#wildcards).

### Environment modes

Turborepo environment modes are now out of experimental mode and are available for general use.

By default, and when `turbo run` is invoked with `--env-mode=loose`, all environment variables from the machine are made available to every single Turborepo task.
This ensures the greatest compatibility while accepting some risk that a task will implicitly have access to a environment variable that is not specified in your `turbo.json`.

In the new strict mode, when `turbo` is invoked with `--env-mode=strict`, only [important system environment variables](/repo/docs/reference/system-environment-variables) and environment variables enumerated inside of `turbo.json` will be made available to a task.

For more, check out the [documentation](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables#environment-modes).

## Community

Since releasing [Turborepo v1.9](/blog/turbo-1-9-0) we've seen incredible adoption and community growth:

- [21.5k+ GitHub Stars](https://github.com/vercel/turbo)
- [1.2M+ weekly NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbo)
- 85 years of compute time saved through [Remote Caching on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching)

Turborepo is the result of the combined work of all of its contributors, including our core team:

- [Jared](https://github.com/jaredpalmer), [Greg](https://github.com/gsoltis), [Nathan](https://github.com/nathanhammond), [Thomas](https://github.com/tknickman), [Mehul](https://github.com/mehulkar), [Chris](https://github.com/chris-olszewski), [Nicholas](https://github.com/NicholasLYang), and [Alexander](https://github.com/arlyon)

Thank you for your continued support, feedback, and collaboration to make Turborepo your build tool of choice.
