Turborepo 1.13 brings a new and improved local development experience along with other enhancements, including:

- [**New terminal UI**](#new-terminal-ui) <ExperimentalBadge />: Interact with your tasks locally in an enhanced terminal experience
- [**Enable the fastest defaults**](#enable-the-fastest-defaults): Make your local development environment faster with `turbo scan`
- [**CI logging improvements**](#ci-logging-improvements): Support for four major providers and automatic unfurling of errored tasks
- [**Enhanced `prune` support**](#enhanced-package-manager-support-for-prune): Bug fixes and improved stability for `turbo prune`

Update today by running `npx @turbo/codemod migrate` or get started with `npx create-turbo@latest`.

## New terminal UI

Until today, `turbo` would output logs as a stream while you were working on your libraries and applications. This could be overwhelming at times since the interleaved logs made it difficult to understand what was going on with a specific task.

With this release, we’re shipping a new, experimental terminal UI, which allows you to:

- **Toggle through the logs of each of your tasks**, making them easier to follow and read
- **Interact with your persistent tasks** by entering and exiting the task’s shell, giving you the ability to re-run unit tests, for example
- **See the duration for each of your tasks** in a bar graph

<ThemeAwareImage
  className="my-4 flex justify-center"
  light={{
    alt: 'A screenshot of a terminal running `turbo scan`.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/experimental-ui.gif',
    props: {
      width: 800,
      height: 350,
      className: 'dark:hidden block',
    },
  }}
  dark={{
    alt: 'A screenshot of a terminal running `turbo scan`.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/experimental-ui.gif',
    props: {
      width: 800,
      height: 350,
      className: 'hidden dark:block',
    },
  }}
/>

To enable the new UI, either use the `--experimental-ui` flag or add the `experimentalUI` flag to your `turbo.json`:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "experimentalUI": true
}
```

**We are looking forward to hearing your feedback on this new feature.** Please [visit the RFC on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/discussions/7802) to share your thoughts.

## Enable the fastest defaults

We want your local development experience to be as fast as possible - through even more than the parallelization and caching of `turbo`.

Running `turbo scan` will inspect your machine for optimizations that make your experience faster.

  light={{
    alt: 'A screenshot of a terminal running `turbo scan`.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/turbo-scan-light.png',
    props: {
      width: 934,
      height: 869,
      className: 'dark:hidden block rounded-xl border border-2',
    },
  }}
  dark={{
    alt: 'A screenshot of a terminal running `turbo scan`.',
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/turbo-scan-dark.png',
    props: {
      width: 1868,
      height: 1800,
      className:
        'hidden dark:block rounded-xl border border-2 dark:border-gray-700',
    },
  }}
/>

## CI logging improvements

This release adds support for automatically grouping successful logs in:

- Azure Pipelines
- TeamCity
- Travis CI

These providers join GitHub Actions, which was already supported.

Additionally, Turborepo now ungroups any tasks that did not complete successfully so you can find errorful tasks faster.

<ThemeAwareImage
  className="my-4 flex justify-center"
  light={{
    alt: "A screenshot of a GitHub Action that ran a `turbo` task. The logs for tasks that completed successfully are folded while the errored task shows it's logs in full with red highlighting.",
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/github-action.png',
    props: {
      width: 3306,
      height: 2607,
      className: 'dark:hidden block rounded-xl',
    },
  }}
  dark={{
    alt: "A screenshot of a GitHub Action that ran a `turbo` task. The logs for tasks that completed successfully are folded while the errored task shows it's logs in full with red highlighting.",
    src: '/images/blog/turbo-1-13-0/github-action.png',
    props: {
      width: 3306,
      height: 2607,
      className: 'hidden dark:block rounded-xl',
    },
  }}
/>

## Enhanced package manager support for `prune`

Turborepo’s `prune` command is an important optimization for Docker users, helping them to create lightweight images from monorepos.

pnpm lockfile support has been upgraded by adding support for [Workspace relative path references](https://pnpm.io/workspaces#referencing-workspace-packages-through-their-relative-path) and respecting the [`link-workspace-packages` property in `.npmrc`](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#link-workspace-packages).

Yarn4 support has been improved by supporting [`resolutions` in `package.json`](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions) at the root of your Workspace.

## Community

Since releasing [Turborepo 1.12](/blog/turbo-1-12-0) we've seen incredible adoption and community growth:

- [24.6k+ GitHub Stars](https://github.com/vercel/turbo)
- [2.3M+ weekly NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbo)
- 283 years of compute time saved using [Vercel Remote Cache](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching)

Turborepo is the result of the combined work of all of its contributors, including our core team.

Thank you for your continued support, feedback, and collaboration to make Turborepo your build tool of choice.
