Upgrade today by running `npx @turbo/codemod migrate` or get started with `npx create-turbo@latest`.

## Boundaries <ExperimentalBadge>Experimental</ExperimentalBadge>

Turborepo is built on top of package manager Workspaces, leaning on ecosystem conventions as a part of determining your repository's task caching. However, this requires that all developers in the repository know and adhere to those conventions.

We're introducing Boundaries, an experimental feature to catch places in the repository where these best practices aren't being followed. This makes caching safer, and ensures your repository is prepared to use future Turborepo features safely.

Try it today using:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo boundaries
```

This early iteration of Boundaries includes finding two types of monorepo mistakes:

- Importing a file outside of the package's directory
- Importing a package that is not specified in dependencies

<Callout type="info" title="Boundaries RFC">
  We look forward to hearing your feedback on [the Boundaries
  RFC](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/discussions/9435), which includes
  proposals for these built-in diagnostics as well as custom-built Boundaries.
</Callout>

To learn more, [visit the documentation](/repo/docs/reference/boundaries).

## Terminal UI improvements

We've continued iterating on the terminal UI, originally released in [Turborepo 2.0](/blog/turbo-2-0).

### Persistent preferences

In previous versions of Turborepo, you would need to reset the terminal UI to your desired state every time you would run `turbo`. In Turborepo 2.4, we'll persist several of the UI selections that you've made, including:

- The task that you had previously selected will be pre-selected the next time you run `turbo`. Give your up and down arrow keys a rest.
- Task list visibility, as described below
- Task selection pinning, as described below

Together, persisting these preferences creates a more seamless experience across `turbo` invocations, restoring the UI to the state from the previous run of `turbo`.

### New keybinds

We've added more functionality to the terminal UI to make it easier to work with your tasks and logs.

- **<Kbd>h</Kbd> to toggle task list**: You're often focused on one of your tasks, so you don't need to see your task list, all the time. Press the <Kbd>h</Kbd> key to show and hide the task list. This feature is a persistent preference, as described above.
- **<Kbd>c</Kbd> to copy logs**: Once you've highlighted a set of logs with your mouse, press <Kbd>c</Kbd> to copy the logs to your system clipboard.
- **<Kbd>j</Kbd> and <Kbd>k</Kbd> to select tasks**: You can now use <Kbd>j</Kbd> and <Kbd>k</Kbd> in addition to <Kbd>↑</Kbd> and <Kbd>↓</Kbd> to cycle through the task list. Vim users rejoice.
- **<Kbd>p</Kbd> to pin the selected task**: Selecting a task sets a "pin", meaning it will continue to be selected as your tasks change states. You can release the pin (or pin the task you're hovering) by pressing <Kbd>p</Kbd>. This feature is a persistent preference, as described above.
- **<Kbd>u</Kbd> and <Kbd>d</Kbd> to scroll logs**: You can now press <Kbd>u</Kbd> to scroll your logs up and <Kbd>d</Kbd> to scroll your logs down.
- **<Kbd>m</Kbd> to learn more**: Pressing <Kbd>m</Kbd> will show a popup listing all of the available keybinds.

## Watch Mode caching <ExperimentalBadge>Experimental</ExperimentalBadge>

[Watch Mode](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/developing-applications#watch-mode) is a monorepo-aware watcher that re-runs tasks according to your [Task Graph](/repo/docs/core-concepts/package-and-task-graph#task-graph). This opens up brand new ways to work in monorepos by leveraging a single, global, dependency-aware watcher, rather than many smaller, less powerful watcher scripts.

In this release, we're adding caching as an experimental feature in Watch Mode. To activate it, use the `--experimental-write-cache` flag:

```bash title="Terminal"
turbo run dev --experimental-write-cache
```

To learn more about Watch Mode, [visit the documentation](/repo/docs/reference/watch).

## Circular dependency recommendations

Circular dependencies are loops in your package graph that create non-deterministic cycles in Turborepo's [Task Graph](/repo/docs/core-concepts/package-and-task-graph#task-graph). However, if there is a loop in your task graph, Turborepo is unable to determine which task comes before which, since they both depend on each other.

While adopting Turborepo in your monorepo, you may find circular dependencies as Turborepo create a more sophisticated, faster Task Graph than your previous task runner. Previously, Turborepo would naively list all of the packages involved in the cycle or cycles that exist in the repository's [Package Graph](/repo/docs/core-concepts/package-and-task-graph#package-graph). Now, Turborepo will include the dependency relationships that need to be broken up to get rid of the cycles in your graph.

  │     { @repo/logger -> @repo/ui, @repo/ui -> storefront }

        api, admin
```

## `schema.json` in `node_modules`

A `schema.json` file provides auto-complete and validation in your editor for JSON files. We have a web-accessible version of the `schema.json` for `turbo.json` hosted at [`https://turbo.build/schema.json`](https://turbo.build/schema.json), but some developers prefer to get the file from `node_modules` to stay synced with the installed version of `turbo`.

Starting in this release, `schema.json` is available in `node_modules` once you've run your package manager's install command:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/turbo/schema.json"
}
```

<Callout title="node_modules location">
  We recommend installing `turbo` at the root of your repository, so the path
  for the schema should point to `node_modules` at the root of your repository.
  In [Package Configurations](/repo/docs/reference/package-configurations), you
  may need to use a path like `../../node_modules/turbo/schema.json`.
</Callout>

## ESLint Flat Config support

Turborepo 2.4 introduces support for ESLint v9 in `eslint-config-turbo` and `eslint-plugin-turbo`, following the end-of life for ESLint v8 on October 5, 2024.

<Tabs items={["eslint-config-turbo", "eslint-plugin-turbo"]}>

<Tab value="eslint-config-turbo">

```ts title="./packages/eslint-config/index.js"
import turboConfig from 'eslint-config-turbo/flat';

export default [
  ...turboConfig,
  // Other configuration
];
```

</Tab>

<Tab value="eslint-plugin-turbo">

```ts title="./packages/eslint-config/index.js"
import turbo from 'eslint-plugin-turbo';

export default [
  {
    plugins: {
      turbo,
    },
    rules: {
      'turbo/no-undeclared-env-vars': 'error',
    },
  },
  // Other configuration
];
```

</Tab>

</Tabs>

The configuration and plugin remain backward compatible for those still using ESLint v8 to ensure a smooth transition.

For more information, [visit the documentation](/repo/docs/reference/eslint-config-turbo).
