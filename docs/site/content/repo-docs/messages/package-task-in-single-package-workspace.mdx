title: Package task in single-package workspace error
description: Learn more about errors with package tasks in single-package workspaces.

## Why this error occurred

In single package mode, there cannot be multiple packages in your repository. Therefore, declaring a task in the
`turbo.json` with a specified package name is not permitted.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "app#build": {
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution

Remove the package name from the task declaration.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "cache": true
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if you would like to have multiple packages, you can [specify the workspaces in your repository](/repo/docs/getting-started/add-to-existing-repository).
