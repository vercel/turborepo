Turborepo is built on the conventions of the JavaScript ecosystem to find scripts and tasks to execute - but it doesn't care what those scripts do. Following [the guidance for specifying a package in a JavaScript workspace](/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository#specifying-packages-in-a-monorepo), you can add any other language or toolchain to Turborepo.

As an example, you may have a Rust project in the `./cli` directory in your repository. To add this directory as a package to your JavaScript package manager's workspace, add the directory to the workspace definition:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Tab>
  ```json title="./package.json"
  {
    "workspaces": [
      "apps/*"
      "packages/*",
      "cli" // [!code highlight]
    ]
  }
  ```

  <LinkToDocumentation href="https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/using-npm/workspaces#defining-workspaces">npm workspace documentation</LinkToDocumentation>
  </Tab>
  <Tab >
  ```json title="./package.json"
  {
    "workspaces": [
      "apps/*"
      "packages/*",
      "cli" // [!code highlight]
    ]
  }
  ```

  <LinkToDocumentation href="https://yarnpkg.com/features/workspaces#how-are-workspaces-declared">yarn workspace documentation</LinkToDocumentation>
   </Tab>
  <Tab>
  ```json title="pnpm-workspace.yaml"
 packages:
    - "apps/*"
    - "packages/*"
    - "cli" // [!code highlight]
  ```
  <LinkToDocumentation href="https://pnpm.io/pnpm-workspace_yaml">pnpm workspace documentation</LinkToDocumentation>

  </Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Then, add a `package.json` to the directory:

```json title="./cli/package.json"
{
  "name": "@repo/rust-cli",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cargo build --release"
  }
}
```

Now, when you use `turbo build`, the `"build"` script in `./cli/package.json` will be included into the tasks that `turbo` runs.

## Caching build artifacts

Ensure that the outputs for your builds are being cached with [the outputs key](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#outputs) in `turbo.json`. In the case of a Rust CLI being compiled with cargo, a release build would be created in the `target/release` directory and we can cache it using:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": ["target/release/**"] // [!code highlight]
    }
  }
}
```

## Creating dependency relationships

Because the directory is now a part of the package manager's workspace, you can create dependencies exactly the same as you do for your JavaScript packages.

For instance, if you wanted to make sure that the `rust-cli` "package" from above is built before your `web` application, install it into the dependencies for the `web` application:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Tab>

```diff title="./web/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
+   "@repo/rust-cli": "*"
  }
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```diff title="./web/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
+   "@repo/rust-cli": "*"
  }
}
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```diff title="./web/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
+   "@repo/rust-cli": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

  </Tab>
</PackageManagerTabs>

Given a `turbo.json` with a `build` task like:

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", "target/release/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

`turbo build` will first create the artifacts for the Rust CLI and then build the `web` application.
