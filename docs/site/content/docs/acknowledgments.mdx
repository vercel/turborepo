title: Acknowledgements
description: Thank you to all these developers, build systems, and monorepo tools for their support and assistance.

Turborepo was originally created by [Jared Palmer](https://x.com/jaredpalmer) as a closed-source enterprise software offering. In late 2021, [Vercel acquired Turborepo](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-turborepo) and open sourced the codebase.

Today, Turborepo has a dedicated full-time team working on it as well as a growing list of [open source contributors](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/graphs/contributors).

## Inspiration and Prior Art

At [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), we believe deeply in the open source movement and in the power of open collaboration. To that end, it's important to provide meaningful attribution to the projects and people that inspire(d) us and our work.
