description: Making the most of Turborepo
---

To get the best experience with `turbo`, Turborepo provides a few utilities for integrating with your editor.

## JSON Schema for `turbo.json`

Turborepo uses [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to give you auto-complete in your
`turbo.json` file. By including the `$schema` key in your `turbo.json`, your editor is able to
provide full documentation and linting in case you have invalid shapes or missing keys.

### Sourcing from the web

Versioned schemas are available via subdomain, following the format `https://v<version>.turborepo.dev/schema.json`. The version uses a dash separator.

```json title="./turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://v2-5-7.turborepo.dev/schema.json"
}
```

This has the advantage of not needing to run your package manager's install command to see in-editor validation, while also ensuring you're using the schema that matches your installed version of `turbo`.

<Callout type="info" title="Unversioned schema">
  If you're using a version of Turborepo older than 2.5.7 or prefer an
  unversioned schema, you can use `https://turborepo.dev/schema.json` instead.
</Callout>

### Sourcing from `node_modules`

Starting in Turborepo 2.4, `schema.json` is available in `node_modules` once you've run your package manager's install command:

```json title="turbo.json"
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/turbo/schema.json"
}
```

<Callout type="info" title="node_modules location">
  We recommend installing `turbo` at the root of your repository, so the path
  for the schema should point to `node_modules` at the root of your repository.
  In [Package Configurations](/docs/reference/package-configurations), you may
  need to use a path like `../../node_modules/turbo/schema.json`.
</Callout>

## Linting for environment variables

Handling environment variables is an important part of building applications in a Turborepo.

[The `eslint-config-turbo` package](/docs/reference/eslint-config-turbo) extends your ESLint setup to help you make sure you've taken care of all of your environment variables.

## Turborepo LSP

Enable even more auto-complete and linting than provided by JSON Schema, with in-editor hinting for invalid globs, references to non-existent tasks or packages, and
extra repository visibility tools.
