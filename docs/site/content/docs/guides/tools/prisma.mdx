import { CreateTurboCallout } from "./create-turbo-callout.tsx";
import { CopyPrompt } from "@/components/copy-prompt";

<CopyPrompt
  title="Set up Prisma in a Turborepo"
  prompt={
    "Set up Prisma in this Turborepo.\n1) Create a database package\n2) Configure the Prisma client\n3) Set up scripts for migrations and generation\n\nWalk me through each step."
  }
/>

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) unlocks a new level of developer experience when working with databases thanks to its intuitive data model, automated migrations, type-safety & auto-completion.

[Their official guide](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/turborepo) describes how to integrate Prisma into a Turborepo, including:

- Prisma client initialization
- Packaging the client as an [Internal Package](/docs/core-concepts/internal-packages)
- Performing migrations
- Working on your applications locally
- Deploying

## Example

To get started with our community-supported Prisma example, run:

```bash title="Terminal"
npx create-turbo@latest -e with-prisma
```
