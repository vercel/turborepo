When using{' '} <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching#vercel-remote-cache" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" >Vercel Remote Cache</a>, this is [your team's slug](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%7E%2Fsettings&title=Get+team+slug). |
2. Clone your repository.
3. Install your dependencies through your package manager.
4. Run your tasks through `turbo`.
