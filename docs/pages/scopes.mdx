# Scoped Tasks

Scoping a task runner can speed up the process especially if there are distinct clusters of packages that are not related to each other within the repository. `turbo` has a `scope` option that allows the task running to proceed up to the packages found that matches the `scope` argument. It's useful to think of `scope` as an "entry point" into your monorepo's package/task graph. This is a string matcher based on the name of the packages (not the package path).

  It is important to note that depedendents and dependencies refer to the
  package & task.

## Scoped tasks with all its dependents

By default, it is helpful to be able to run tasks on all affected packages within a scope. Packages that changed will affect downstream consumers. In this case, pass along the `scope` to build all the dependencies as well.

  Note: you can use wild card character: `*`. This is particularly helpful when
  packages are named by group or by scope.
</Callout>

```sh
turbo run build --scope=*build-tools*
```

## Scoped tasks with no dependents & their dependencies

Sometimes we want to run the tasks needed to satisfy the `build` script of all the packages that has the `build-tools` string in their names. Think of this as running tasks up and including the package matched in the scope. Simply add a `--no-deps` flag to run up to a package task.

```sh
turbo run build --scope=*build-tools* --no-deps --includeDependencies
```
