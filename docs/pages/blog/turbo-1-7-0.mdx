Turborepo 1.7 focuses on improving developer experience by bringing more clarity to your tasks:

- [**Improved support for long running tasks**](#schedule-your-long-running-tasks-with-confidence): Use `persistent: true` to mark non-terminating tasks so that `turbo` can alert you if you have dependencies on them.
- [**Better clarity for outputs**](#declare-your-outputs-for-improved-clarity): You'll now always need to declare your task outputs, improving transparency to what your tasks will cache.
- [**Globally installable**](#global-turbo): Install once, use everywhere. Turborepo can now be installed globally, and ran from any directory, not just from your repo root.
- [**“Error only” output mode**](#errors-only-output-mode-for-quieter-logs): Quiet your output logs to only show when a task fails.

Update today by running `npm install turbo@latest`, or by [installing globally](#global-turbo) <Badge>NEW</Badge> and running the [`set-default-outputs`](/repo/docs/reference/codemods#set-default-outputs) codemod.

## Schedule your long-running tasks with confidence

To avoid misconfigurations that could result in tasks that never run, you can now tell Turborepo about tasks that won't exit on their own (like `dev` scripts) with a `persistent: true` [configuration option](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#persistent). When this config is set on a task, Turborepo will ensure no other task can depend on this task. This is useful for `dev` tasks or test runners with `--watch` flags.

```diff
{
	"pipeline": {
		"dev": {
+			"persistent": true
		}
	}
}
```

Previously, if `Task B` depended on a persistent `Task A`, `Task B` would never execute, because `Task A` never exited. By declaring `Task A` as `persistent`, Turborepo will prevent this error scenario from happening.

Before this release, we had been recommending the use of `turbo run <task> --parallel` for persistent tasks. With `--parallel`, `turbo` would ignore your dependency graph and execute all your tasks at once.

While `--parallel` did provide a helpful escape hatch, it meant that users had to tell Turborepo **_how_** to run their tasks rather than declaring **_what_** a task is.

Rather than throwing away your entire topological dependency graph, it's much more precise for Turborepo to keep your dependency graph while guaranteeing that you don't depend on a process that won't exit with `persistent: true`.

## Global `turbo`

You can now run your Turborepo tasks from anywhere in your project once you've installed `turbo` globally. To do so, use:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install turbo --global
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn global add turbo
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm install turbo --global
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

`turbo` will now work in any project. To find your local `turbo` version, `turbo` will walk through a few steps, always looking upward from your current directory:

1. Find the nearest turbo.json.
2. If one is not found, find the first `package.json` with a `workspaces` property.
3. If one is not found, find the first `package.json`.

Your globally installed version of `turbo` will only be used when a locally installed version of `turbo` does not exist or cannot be found.

`turbo --version` and `turbo bin` will show you the version and binary location, respectively, of the copy of `turbo` that will execute your tasks.
Additionally, running with `-vv` or `--verbosity=2` will always show if your local, or global `turbo` is being used.

```bash
turbo --version --verbosity=2
2023-01-11T10:49:04.042-0500 [DEBUG] turborepo_lib::shim: No local turbo binary found at: /Users/knickman/Developer/vercel/my-awesome-monorepo/node_modules/.bin/turbo
2023-01-11T10:49:04.042-0500 [DEBUG] turborepo_lib::shim: Running command as global turbo
1.7.0
```

## Declare your `outputs` for improved clarity

Previously, if you did not specify an `outputs` key for a task, Turborepo would automatically attempt to cache all files in the `dist/` and `build/` directories.

This worked well for `build` tasks of specific frameworks, but this implicit behavior did not scale well as it applied to _all_ tasks. We've found that, across the many developers, teams, projects, and codebases using Turborepo, the assumption to automatically cache `dist/` and `build/` directories was causing problems for users.

In version 1.7, this behavior is removed and you will now need to explicitly tell turborepo what to cache.

```diff
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
+     "outputs": ["dist/**", "build/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

If you were relying on the default cache output in Turborepo versions below 1.7, you can get the same behavior by running the [`@turbo/codemod set-default-outputs`](/repo/docs/reference/codemods#set-default-outputs) codemod:

```bash
npx @turbo/codemod set-default-outputs
```

Also note that you will no longer need to specify `outputs: []` because not caching anything is now the default behavior. The codemod will also remove this configuration from your tasks.

## “Errors only” output mode for quieter logs

To bring visibility to errors, community member [@dobesv](https://github.com/dobesv) contributed [a solution to only show errors instead of all logs from a task run](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2588). While debugging a pipeline, `--output-logs=errors-only` can be used to keep your signal-to-noise ratio high so you can focus on ensuring successful runs for your pipelines.
This can be used as a [configuration option](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#outputmode) or as a [CLI flag](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference#--output-logs)

```bash
turbo build --output-logs=errors-only
```

## Community

Since releasing [Turborepo v1.6](/blog/turbo-1-6-0) and merging with [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack), we've seen incredible adoption and community growth:

- [18.7k+ GitHub Stars](https://github.com/vercel/turbo)
- [750k weekly NPM downloads](https://www.npmjs.com/package/turbo)
- 30 years of compute time saved through [Remote Caching on Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/remote-caching)

Turborepo is the result of the combined work of all of our contributors including our core team.

Thank you for your continued support, feedback, and collaboration to make Turborepo your build tool of choice.
