<p className="text-gray-500 mt-6 uppercase text-sm tracking-wider">Summary</p>

- We are thankful for the work of the entire OSS ecosystem and the incredible interest and reception from the [Turbopack release](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack). We look forward to continuing our collaboration with and integration into the broader Web ecosystem of tooling and frameworks.
- In this article, you’ll find our methodology and documentation supporting the benchmarks that show **Turbopack is up to [10x and 700x faster](#bench) than existing approaches.**
- **Turbopack** and [**Next.js 13.0.1**](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v13.0.1) are out addressing a regression that snuck in prior to public release and after the initial benchmarks were taken. We also fixed an incorrect rounding bug on our website (`0.01s` → `15ms`). We appreciate [Evan You](https://twitter.com/youyuxi)'s work that helped us identify and [correct this](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/pull/2516).
- We’re excited to continue to evolve the incremental build architecture of Turbopack. We believe that there are still significant performance wins on the table.

<hr className="mt-8 w-full border-gray-400 authors border-opacity-20"/>

At [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org), [we announced](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiknNI_0J48) our latest open-source project: Turbopack, an incremental bundler and build system optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust.

The project began as an exploration to improve Webpack’s performance and create ways for it to more easily integrate with tooling moving forward. In doing so, the team realized that a greater effort was necessary. While we saw opportunities for better performance, the premise of a new architecture that could scale to the largest projects in the world was inspiring.

In this post, we’ll explore why Turbopack is so fast, how its incremental engine works, and benchmark it against existing approaches.

## Why is Turbopack _blazing_ fast?

Turbopack’s speed comes from its incremental computation engine. Similar to trends we've seen in frontend state libraries, computational work is split into reactive functions that enable Turbopack to apply updates to an existing compilation without going through a full graph recomputation and bundling lifecycle.

This does not work like traditional caching where you look up a result from a cache before an operation and then decide whether or not to use it. That would be too slow.

Instead, Turbopack skips work altogether for cached results and only recomputes affected parts of its internal dependency graph of functions. This makes updates independent of the size of the whole compilation, and eliminates the usual overhead of traditional caching.

## Benchmarking Turbopack, Webpack, and Vite

We created a test generator that makes an application with a variable amount of modules to benchmark cold startup and file updating tasks. This generated app includes entries for these tools:

- Next.js 11
- Next.js 12
- Next.js 13 with Turbopack
- Vite

As the current state of the art, we're including [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) along with Webpack-based [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) solutions. All of these toolchains point to the same generated component tree, assembling a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) in the browser, where every triangle is a separate module.

### Cold startup time

This test measures how fast a local development server starts up on an application of various sizes. We measure this as the time from startup (without cache) until the app is rendered in the browser. We do not wait for the app to be interactive or hydrated in the browser for this dataset.

#### Data

To run this benchmark yourself, clone [`vercel/turbo`](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) and then use this command from the root:

```sh
TURBOPACK_BENCH_COUNTS=1000,5000,10000,30000 TURBOPACK_BENCH_BUNDLERS=all cargo bench -p next-dev "startup/(Turbopack SSR|Next.js 12 SSR|Next.js 11 SSR|Vite CSR)."
```

Here are the numbers we were able to produce on a 14” MacBook Pro 2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, macOS 12.6 (21G115):

```sh

```

### File updates (HMR)

We also measure how quickly the development server works from when an update is applied to a source file to when we receive a custom browser event that the modified code was executed.

Note that executing modified code does not mean that the changes are visible to the user yet. When a React component changes, it still needs to be re-rendered by the browser. With this methodology, we are focusing _only_ on the time the compiler takes to do its work and the time it takes for the browser to evaluate an updated module.

For Hot Module Reloading (HMR) benchmarks, we first start the dev server on a fresh installation with the test application. We then run five changes to warm up the tooling. This step is important as it prevents discrepancies that can arise with cold processes.

Once our tooling is warmed up, we measure the sixth file update. After repeating this 10 times, we use the average as our final number.

From our benchmarks, we find the following:

- Turbopack HMR is **10x faster than Vite once the application scales above 30k modules**. These marks continue to improve with more modules, showing 20x faster above 50k modules.
- Turbopack HMR is **700x faster than Webpack-based Next.js 11** for large applications with over 50k modules.

The takeaway: Turbopack performance is a function of **the size of an update**, not the size of an application.

## The future of the open-source Web

Our team has taken the lessons from 10 years of Webpack, combined with the innovations in incremental computation from [Turborepo](/repo) and Google's Bazel, and created an architecture ready to support the coming decades of computing.

Our goal is to create a system of open source tooling that helps to build the future of the Web—powered by Turbopack. We're creating a reusable piece of architecture that will make both development and warm production builds faster for everyone.

For Turbopack's alpha, we are including it in Next.js 13. But, in time, [we hope that Turbopack will power other frameworks and builders](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1585040276447690752?s=20&t=YV0ASkHl5twCWQvJF5jpwg) as a seamless, low-level, incremental engine to build great developer experiences with.

We look forward to being a part of the community bringing developers better tooling so that they can continue to deliver better experiences to end users.
