Turborepo 1.5 is a **huge leap forward for our documentation and DX**, as well as bringing big improvements to `turbo prune`:

- [**The Monorepo Handbook**](#the-monorepo-handbook): We've built the missing manual for your monorepo - a guide on workspaces, code sharing, integrating common tools and much more.
- [**No need to run**](#run-no-longer-needed): `turbo run <task>` can now be shortened to `turbo <task>`
- [**Prune now supported on pnpm, yarn and npm**](#prune-now-supported-on-npm-pnpm-and-yarn): Pruning your monorepo is now supported in all major package managers.
- [**Improved environment variables in `turbo.json`**](#environment-variables-in-turbojson): Environment variables are now first-class citizens in your Turborepo pipeline configuration.
- [**Changes to `package.json` hashing**](#changes-to-packagejson-hashing): We've improved how we hash `package.json` when running tasks.

Update today by running `npm install turbo@latest`.

## The Monorepo Handbook

Setting up a monorepo for the first time often means navigating a lot of new concepts. You'll need to understand workspaces, package installation, sharing code and dependency management - and a lot more.

This often meant that folks who wanted to set up a monorepo from scratch had to piece information together from different documentation sites. First `pnpm`, then `tsup`, then back to `changesets`, then back to Turborepo for dessert.

We want to fill this gap with [the Monorepo Handbook](/docs/handbook). We've built guides on how to integrate all the tools you'll need to make ship happen with your monorepo, including guides on:

- Installing Packages
- Linting
- Development Tasks
- Building Apps
- Publishing Packages

{/* TODO - link these */}

## `run` no longer needed

You can now run tasks with the Turborepo CLI using `turbo <task>`.

```diff
- turbo run build
+ turbo build


- turbo run lint build test
+ turbo lint build test
```

If your task name conflicts with a built-in `turbo` subcommand, we'll run our subcommand instead. That means you shouldn't name your tasks things like `prune`, `run`, or `login` - since those are built-in subcommands.

`turbo run <task>` will continue to work, and there are no plans to deprecate it.

## Prune now supported on `npm`, `pnpm` and `yarn`

We're delighted to announce that `turbo prune --scope=<package-name>` is now supported in all major package managers.

`turbo prune` lets you create a subset of your monorepo, focused on deploying a single application.

Let's say that you have a monoreopo like this:

```
monorepo
├─ apps
│  ├─ api
│  ├─ mobile
├─ packages
│  ├─ shared-utils
│  ├─ tsconfig
```

If you want to deploy only `apps/api`, you can run:

```bash
turbo prune --scope="api"
```

You'd get an output that looks like this:

```
Generating pruned monorepo for api in /my-turborepo/out
 - Added api
 - Added shared-utils
 - Added tsconfig
```

And the `/out` directory would look like this:

```
out
├─ apps
│  ├─ api
├─ packages
│  ├─ shared-utils
│  ├─ tsconfig
```

Not only would `mobile` be removed, but **all of its dependencies would be removed from the root lockfile**. This means that you can create a streamlined version of your monorepo that only installs the dependencies it needs.

### Deploying to Docker

This is particularly useful for deploying to Docker. Without pruning your monorepo, changes which _don't affect your deployed application_ would cause it to re-deploy. Pruning your monorepo before copying it to your Docker image ensures that Docker Layer Caching won't be thrown off by unrelated dependencies.

## Environment variables in `turbo.json`

We've introduced two new keys to `turbo.json` - `env` and `globalEnv`. These allow environment variables to be configured _separately_ from tasks:

```diff filename="turbo.json"
{
  "globalDependencies": [
-   "$DATABASE_URL"
  ]
+ "globalEnv": [
+   "DATABASE_URL"
+ ],
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": [
-       "$BUILD_ENV"
      ],
+     "env": [
+       "BUILD_ENV"
+     ]
    }
  }
}
```

`globalEnv` and `env` allow you to specify a list of environment variables _without_ `$` prefixes. This makes the configuration file significantly easier to read.

To help migrate from the previous syntax, we've prepared a codemod. You can run `npx @turbo/codemod env-key`.

You can also upgrade the `eslint-config-turbo` package to `latest` if you want to validate your turbo.json.

## Changes to `package.json` hashing

The `package.json` file in each workspace is now _always_ considered an input for tasks in that workspace. This means that if you change the _definition_ for a task in `package.json`, we want to invalidate any caches from the previous definition.

This also counts for the `package.json` in the root. Changes to the root `package.json` will invalidate tasks in the root workspace.

This helps make Turborepo's cache a bit smarter, and less likely to trip up when task definitions change.
