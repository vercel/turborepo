# Benchmarks

We created a test generator that makes an application with a variable amount of modules to benchmark cold startup and file updating tasks. This generated app includes entries for these tools:

- Next.js 11
- Next.js 12
- Next.js 13 with Turbopack
- Vite

As the current state of the art, we're including [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) along with Webpack-based [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) solutions. All of these toolchains point to the same generated component tree, assembling a [Sierpiński triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpi%C5%84ski_triangle) in the browser, where every triangle is a separate module.

## Metrics

Let's break down exactly what each of these metrics mean, and how they'll impact your day-to-day developer experience.

### Cold startup time

This test measures how fast a local development server starts up on an application of various sizes. We measure this as the time from startup (without cache) until the app is rendered in the browser. We do not wait for the app to be interactive or hydrated in the browser for this dataset.

#### Data

To run this benchmark yourself, clone [`vercel/turbo`](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) and then use this command from the root:

```sh
TURBOPACK_BENCH_COUNTS=1000,5000,10000,30000 TURBOPACK_BENCH_BUNDLERS=all cargo bench -p next-dev "startup/(Turbopack SSR|Next.js 12 SSR|Next.js 11 SSR|Vite CSR)."
```

Here are the numbers we were able to produce on a 14” MacBook Pro 2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, macOS 12.6 (21G115):

### File updates (HMR)

We also measure how quickly the development server works from when an update is applied to a source file to when the corresponding change is re-rendered in the browser.

For Hot Module Reloading (HMR) benchmarks, we first start the dev server on a fresh installation with the test application. We wait for the HMR server to boot up by running updates until one succeeds. We then run ten changes to warm up the tooling. This step is important as it prevents discrepancies that can arise with cold processes.

Once our tooling is warmed up, we run a series of updates to a list of modules within the test application. Modules are sampled randomly with a distribution that ensures we test a uniform number of modules per module depth. The depth of a module is its distance from the entry module in the dependency graph. For instance, if the entry module A imports module B, which imports modules C and D, the depth of the entry module A will be 0, that of module B will be 1, and that of modules C and D will be 2. Modules A and B will have an equal probability of being sampled, but modules C and D will only have half the probability of being sampled.

We report the linear regression slope of the data points as the target metric. This is an estimate of the average time it takes for the tooling to apply an update to the application.

The takeaway from these benchmarks: Turbopack performance is a function of **the size of an update**, not the size of an application.

We're excited by Turbopack's performance, but we also expect to make further speed improvements for both small and large applications in the future.
