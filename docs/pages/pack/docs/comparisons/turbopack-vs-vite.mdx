# Turbopack vs Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is a development environment that uses Native ESM to deliver a snappy dev server. Before we built Turbopack, we considered Vite as one of several options to speed up Next's dev server.

However, we decided that Vite's Native ESM architecture brought too many speed bottlenecks. To learn more about that decision, check out our docs on [why we created Turbopack](/pack/docs/why-turbopack).

## Speed

Turbopack can outperform Vite on several key metrics.

### Dev server startup time

Turbopack's dev server starts up much faster than Vite. On a 1,000 module application, Vite takes <DocsBenchmarkStat stat="vite-cold-1000" /> to start up. Turbopack starts up in <DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-cold-1000" /> - **<DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-cold-vs-vite" /> faster**.

In large applications, this differential stays consistent. In a 30,000 module application, Turbopack starts up <DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-cold-vs-vite-30000" /> faster than Vite.

  },

    key: 'vite',
  }
]} />

### Code updates

When a file changes, it needs to render the change to the browser. The faster it can do that, the tighter your feedback loop and the faster you'll ship.

In a 1,000 module application, Turbopack can react to file changes **<DocsBenchmarkStat stat="turbopack-update-vs-vite" /> faster** than Vite.

    key: 'vite',
  }
]} />
