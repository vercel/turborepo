# Filtering Workspaces

A monorepo can contain hundreds, or thousands, of workspaces. By default, running `turbo run test` will execute the `test` task in **all available workspaces**.

![Without using a filter, test will be run across all packages](../../../../../public/images/docs/no-filter.png)

Turborepo supports a `--filter` flag that lets you **select the workspaces you'd like to execute your task in**.

![With a filter on shared, only the shared package runs test](../../../../../public/images/docs/with-filter.png)

You can use it to:

- Filter by [workspace name](#filter-by-workspace-name)
- Filter by [workspace directory](#filter-by-directory)
- Include [dependents](#include-dependents-of-matched-workspaces) and [dependencies](#include-dependencies-of-matched-workspaces) of matched workspaces
- Execute tasks from the [workspace root](#the-workspace-root)
- Filter by [changes in git history](#filter-by-changed-workspaces)
- [Exclude workspaces](#excluding-workspaces) from selection

Turborepo will run each task against each matched workspace, ensuring that any tasks which depend on it are run first, according to the `pipeline` specification in [`turbo.json`](/docs/reference/configuration#pipeline).

## Filter Syntax

### Multiple filters

You can specify more than one filter by passing multiple `--filter` flags to the command:

```sh
turbo run build --filter=my-pkg --filter=my-app
```

### Filter by workspace name

When you want to run a script in only one workspace, you can use a single filter: `--filter=my-pkg`.

```sh
# Build 'my-pkg', letting `turbo` infer task dependencies
# from the pipeline defined in turbo.json
turbo run build --filter=my-pkg

# Build '@acme/bar', letting `turbo` infer task dependencies
# from the pipeline defined in turbo.json
turbo run build --filter=@acme/bar
```

If you want to run tasks inside several workspaces with similar names, you can use glob syntax: `--filter=*my-pkg*`.

```sh
# Build all workspaces that start with 'admin-', letting turbo infer task
# dependencies from the pipeline defined in turbo.json
turbo run build --filter=admin-*
```

#### Scopes

Some monorepos prepend their workspace names with a scope, such as `@acme/ui` and `@acme/app`. As long as the scope (`@acme`) is unique across the codebase, you may omit it from filters.

```diff
- turbo run build --filter=@acme/ui
+ turbo run build --filter=ui
```

### Include dependents of matched workspaces

Sometimes, you'll want to ensure that your shared package isn't affecting any downstream dependencies. For that, you can use `--filter=...my-lib`.

If `my-app` depends on `my-lib`, `...my-lib` will select `my-app` and `my-lib`.

Including a `^` (`...^my-lib`) will select all of `my-lib`'s dependents, but not `my-lib` itself.

```sh
# Test 'my-lib' and everything that depends on 'my-lib'
turbo run test --filter=...my-lib

# Test everything that depends on 'my-lib', but not 'my-lib' itself
turbo run test --filter=...^my-lib
```

### Include dependencies of matched workspaces

Sometimes, you'll want to make sure that `build` is run in all of the dependencies of the lib you're targeting. For that, you can use `--filter=my-app...`.

If `my-app` depends on `my-lib`, `my-app...` will select `my-app` and `my-lib`.

Including a `^` (`my-app^...`) will select all of `my-app`'s dependencies, but not `my-app` itself.

```sh
# Build 'my-app' and its dependencies
turbo run build --filter=my-app...

# Build 'my-app's dependencies, but not 'my-app' itself
turbo run build --filter=my-app^...
```

### Filter by directory

Useful for when you want to target a specific directory, not a workspace name. It supports:

- Exact matches: `--filter=./apps/docs`
- Globs: `--filter=./apps/*`

```sh
# Build all of the workspaces in the 'apps' directory
turbo run build --filter=./apps/*
```

#### Combining with other syntaxes

When combining directory filters with other syntaxes, enclose in `{}`. For example:

```sh
# Build all of the workspaces in the 'libs' directory,
# and all the workspaces that depends on them
turbo run build --filter=...{./libs/*}
```

### Filter by changed workspaces

You can run tasks on any workspaces which have changed since a certain commit. These need to be wrapped in `[]`.

For example, `--filter=[HEAD^1]` will select all workspaces that have changed in the most recent commit:

```sh
# Test everything that changed in the last commit
turbo run test --filter=[HEAD^1]
```

#### Check a range of commits

If you need to check a specific range of commits, rather than comparing to `HEAD`, you can set both ends of the comparison via `[<from commit>...<to commit>]`.

```sh
# Test each workspace that changed between 'main' and 'my-feature'
turbo run test --filter=[main...my-feature]
```

#### Ignoring changed files

You can use [`--ignore`](/docs/reference/command-line-reference#--ignore) to specify changed files to be ignored in the calculation of which workspaces have changed.

#### Combining with other syntaxes

You can additionally prepend the commit reference with `...` to match the dependencies of other components
against the changed workspaces. For instance, to select `foo` if any of `foo`'s dependencies have changed in the last commit,
you can pass `--filter=foo...[HEAD^1]`.

```sh
# Build everything that depends on changes in branch 'my-feature'
turbo run build --filter=...[origin/my-feature]

# Build '@foo/bar' if it or any of its dependencies
# changed in the last commit
turbo run build --filter=@foo/bar...[HEAD^1]
```

You can even combine `[]` and `{}` syntax together:

```sh
# Test each workspace in the '@scope' scope that
# is in the 'packages' directory, if it has
# changed in the last commit
turbo run test --filter=@scope/*{./packages/*}[HEAD^1]
```

### The workspace root

The monorepo's root can be selected using the token `//`.

```sh
# Run the format script from the root "package.json" file:
turbo run format --filter=//
```

### Excluding workspaces

Prepend `!` to the filter. Matched workspaces from the entire filter will be excluded from the set of targets.
For example, match everything except `@foo/bar`: `--filter=!@foo/bar`. Note that you may need to escape `!` as appropriate for your shell (e.g. `\!`).

```sh
# Build everything except '@foo/bar'
turbo run build --filter=!@foo/bar
# Build all of the workspaces in the 'apps' directory, except the 'admin' workspace
turbo run build --filter=./apps/* --filter=!admin
```
