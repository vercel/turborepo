# Skipping Tasks

[Build caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching) can dramatically speed up your build tasks - but you can do even better by using `npx turbo-ignore`. If your workspace is unaffected by your code changes, you can completely skip executing a task altogether.

## Using `turbo-ignore`

To skip unaffected work, ensure that your git history is available and run `npx turbo-ignore`.

By default, `turbo-ignore` will run the **build** task in the current working directory. Under the hood, `turbo-ignore` uses the output of `--dry=json` from your parent commit to your current commit to identify affected packages.

Here's an example of the command that will be built and ran:

```bash
npx turbo run build --filter=@example/web...[3c8387ffd98b751305fe3f0284befdd00cbd4610] --dry=json
```

Note that this command does not _execute_ the build task. Instead, it uses a **dry run** to see if your code changes will affect your build compared to your parent commit.

If `turbo-ignore` finds that the task can be skipped, it will exit the process with a `0` code. If changes have been found, the process will exit with `1`.

## Customizing behavior

To specify a workspace, you can add it to your command like:

```
npx turbo-ignore web
```

where `web` is your workspace's name.

If you'd like to change more of the default behavior, there are a few flags available:

- `--task`: Specifies the task for the command that `turbo-ignore` will invoke. Defaults to `build`.
- `--directory`: Specify a directory where `turbo-ignore` will run.
- `--fallback`: Specify a ref/head to compare against.

## Example

Let's say you want to skip the unit tests for your `web` workspace when there aren't any changes to your `web` application or its package dependencies. In practice, hitting the cache with a `>>> FULL TURBO` will speed things up quite a bit but there will still be time spent installing `npm` dependencies, creating upcoming CI infrastructure, or doing other types of work that can take awhile.

Ideally, we would do a quick check to see if any of that work needs to happen in the first place.

After we've checked out the repo but **before** any other work, we can take a few seconds to check that our `web` tests have changed since the parent commit.

```bash
npx turbo-ignore web --task=test
```

This command will:

1. Filter for the `web` workspace.
2. Create the `dry` output for your `test` task compared to your parent commit.
3. Parse the output to determine which packages have changed.
4. Exit with a `1` code if changes are detected. Otherwise, exits with a `0`.

While you may have been able to hit a `>>> FULL TURBO` cache for your build task, we just saved time with all of the other setup tasks required to run your CI to make it to the full cache hit.

## Using `turbo-ignore` on Vercel

To use `npx turbo-ignore` on Vercel, you can use the [Ignored Build Step](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/overview#ignored-build-step) feature. Vercel will automatically infer the correct arguments to successfully run `turbo-ignore`.
