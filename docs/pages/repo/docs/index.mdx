# Turborepo Quickstart

Turborepo is a smart **build system for JavaScript/TypeScript monorepos**: codebases containing multiple projects, often using multiple frameworks, in a single, unified code repository.

Unlike other build systems, Turborepo is designed to be **incrementally adopted**, so you can add it to most codebases in a few minutes.

## Features

Turborepo leverages advanced build system techniques to speed up development, **both on your local machine and your CI/CD**.

## Examples

You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. For even more examples and starters, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/tree/main/examples).
