# Using Turborepo with GitHub Actions

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

For a given root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "1.2.5"
  }
}
```

And a `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

Create file called `.github/workflows/ci.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">

    ```yaml
    name: CI

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with GitHub Actions, add the following environment variables to your GitHub Actions workflow
to make them available to your `turbo` commands.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-tokens.png)
![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your GitHub repository settings and click on the **Secrets** and then **Actions** tab. Create a new secret called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

![GitHub Secrets Create](/images/docs/github-actions-create-secret.png)

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL _without_ the `vercel.com/`. Your Team URL can be found inside your team's general project settings from the dashboard.

   If you're using a Hobby Plan, you can use your username. Your username can be found in your [Vercel Personal Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account)

4. At the top of your GitHub Actions workflow, provide the following environment variables to jobs that use `turbo`:

```yaml highlight="6-8"
# ...

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build and Test
    timeout-minutes: 15
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # To use Turborepo Remote Caching, set the following environment variables for the job.
    env:
      TURBO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}
      TURBO_TEAM: ${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}

    steps:
      - name: Check out code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 2
    # ...
```
