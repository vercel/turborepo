# Using Turborepo with Travis CI

The following example shows how to use Turborepo with [Travis CI](https://www.travis-ci.com/).

For a given root `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-turborepo",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "test": "turbo run test"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "1.2.5"
  }
}
```

And a `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": []
    },
  }
}
```

Create a file called `.travis.yml` in your repository with the following contents:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```yaml
    language: node_js
    node_js:
      - lts/*
    install:
      - npm install
    script:
      - npm run build
    script:
      - npm run test
    ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
      Travis CI detects the use of Yarn by the presence of `yarn.lock`. It will automatically ensure it is installed.
      ```yaml
      language: node_js
      node_js:
        - lts/*
      install:
        - yarn
      script:
        - yarn build
      script:
        - yarn test
      ```
  </Tab>
    <Tab>
      ```yaml
      language: node_js
      node_js:
        - lts/*
      cache:
        npm: false
        directories:
          - "~/.pnpm-store"
      before_install:
        - curl -f https://get.pnpm.io/v6.16.js | node - add --global pnpm@6.32.2
        - pnpm config set store-dir ~/.pnpm-store
      install:
        - pnpm install
      script:
        - pnpm build
      script:
        - pnpm test
      ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Remote Caching

To use Remote Caching with Travis CI, add the following environment variables to your Travis CI project.

- `TURBO_TOKEN` - The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache
- `TURBO_TEAM` - The account to which the monorepo belongs

To use Vercel Remote Caching, you can get the value of these variables in a few steps:

1. Create a Scoped Access Token to your account in the [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/account/tokens)

![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-tokens.png)
![Vercel Access Tokens](/images/docs/vercel-create-token.png)

Copy the value to a safe place. You'll need it in a moment.

2. Go to your Travis repository settings and scroll down to the _Environment Variables_ section. Create a new variable called `TURBO_TOKEN` and enter the value of your Scoped Access Token.

3. Make a second secret called `TURBO_TEAM` and enter the value of your team's Vercel URL _without_ the `vercel.com/`. Your Team URL can be found inside your team's general project settings from the dashboard.

   If you're using a Hobby Plan, you can use your username. Your username can be found in your [Vercel Personal Account Settings](https://vercel.com/account)

4. Travis CI automatically loads environment variables stored in project settings into the CI environment. No modifications are necessary for the CI file.
