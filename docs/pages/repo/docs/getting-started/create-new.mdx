# Creating a new monorepo

## Quickstart

To create a new monorepo, use our [`create-turbo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-turbo) npm package:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

You can also clone a Turborepo starter repository to get a head start on your monorepo. To see Turborepo examples and starters, see the [Turborepo examples directory on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples).

## Full tutorial

This tutorial will walk you through using the Turborepo [`basic` example](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/basic). By the end, you'll feel confident with using `turbo`, and know all the basic functionality.

<Callout type="info">

During this tutorial, some lines of code are omitted from the code samples. For instance, when showing a `package.json` we won't show _all_ of the keys - only the ones that matter.

</Callout>

### 1. Running `create-turbo`

First, run:

```sh
npx create-turbo@latest
```

This installs the [`create-turbo`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-turbo) CLI, and runs it. You'll be asked several questions:

#### Where would you like to create your turborepo?

Choose anywhere you like. The default is `./my-turborepo`.

#### Which package manager do you want to use?

Turborepo doesn't handle installing packages, so you'll need to choose either:

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com//)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

If you're not sure, we recommend choosing `pnpm`. If you don't have it installed, cancel `create-turbo` (via `ctrl-C`) and take a look at the [installation instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation).

#### Installation

Once you've picked a package manager, `create-turbo` will create a bunch of new files inside the folder name you picked. It'll also install all the dependencies that come with the `basic` example by default.

### 2. Exploring your new repo

You might have noticed something in the terminal. `create-turbo` gave you a description of all of the things it was adding.

```
>>> Creating a new turborepo with the following:

 - apps/web: Next.js with TypeScript
 - apps/docs: Next.js with TypeScript
 - packages/ui: Shared React component library
 - packages/eslint-config-custom: Shared configuration (ESLint)
 - packages/tsconfig: Shared TypeScript `tsconfig.json`
```

Each of these is a _workspace_ - a folder containing a `package.json`. Each workspace can declare its own dependencies, run its own scripts, and export code for other workspaces to use.

Open the root folder - `./my-turborepo` - in your favourite code editor.

#### Understanding `packages/ui`

First, open `./packages/ui/package.json`. You'll notice that the package's name is `"name": "ui"` - right at the top of the file.

Next, open `./apps/web/package.json`. You'll notice that this package's name is `"name": "web"`. But also - take a look in its dependencies.

You'll see that `"web"` depends on a package called `"ui"`. If you're using `pnpm`, you'll see it's declared like this:

```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

This means that our **web app depends on our local `ui` package**.

If you look inside `apps/docs/package.json`, you'll see the same thing. Both `web` and `docs` depend on `ui` - a shared component library.

This pattern of sharing code across applications is extremely common in monorepos - and means that multiple apps can share a single design system.

#### Understanding imports and exports

Take a look inside `./apps/docs/pages/index.tsx`. Both `docs` and `web` are [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) applications, and they both use the `ui` library in a similar way:

```tsx filename="apps/docs/pages/index.tsx"
import { Button } from "ui";
//       ^^^^^^         ^^

export default function Docs() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Docs</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

They're importing `Button` directly from a dependency called `ui`! How does that work? Where is `Button` coming from?

Open `packages/ui/package.json`. You'll notice these two attributes:

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "main": "./index.tsx",
  "types": "./index.tsx"
}
```

When workspaces import from `ui`, `main` tells them where to access the code they're importing. `types` tells them where the TypeScript types are located.

So, let's look inside `packages/ui/index.tsx`:

```tsx filename="packages/ui/index.tsx"
import * as React from "react";
export * from "./Button";
```

Everything inside this file will be able to be used by workspaces that depend on `ui`.

`index.tsx` is exporting everything from a file called `./Button`, so let's go there:

```tsx filename="packages/ui/Button.tsx"
import * as React from "react";

export const Button = () => {
  return <button>Boop</button>;
};
```

We've found our button! Any changes we make in this file will be shared across `web` and `docs`. Pretty cool!

<Callout type="idea">

Try experimenting with exporting a different function from this file. Perhaps `add(a, b)` for adding two numbers together.

This can then be imported by `web` and `docs`.

</Callout>

#### Understanding `tsconfig`

We have two more workspaces to look at, `tsconfig` and `eslint-config-custom`. Each of these allow for shared configuration across the monorepo. Let's look in `tsconfig`:

```json filename="packages/tsconfig/package.json"
{
  "name": "tsconfig",
  "files": ["base.json", "nextjs.json", "react-library.json"]
}
```

Here, we specify three files to be exported, inside `files`. Packages which depend on `tsconfig` can then import them directly.

For instance, `packages/ui` depends on `tsconfig`:

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "tsconfig": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

And inside its `tsconfig.json` file, it imports it using `extends`:

```json filename="packages/ui/tsconfig.json"
{
  "extends": "tsconfig/react-library.json"
}
```

This pattern allows for a monorepo to share a single `tsconfig.json` across all its workspaces, reducing code duplication.

#### Understanding `eslint-config-custom`

Our final workspace is `eslint-config-custom`.

You'll notice that this is named slightly differently to the other workspaces. It's not as concise as `ui` or `tsconfig`. Let's take a look inside `.eslintrc.js` in the root of the monorepo to figure out why.

```ts filename=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  // This tells ESLint to load the config from the workspace `eslint-config-custom`
  extends: ["custom"],
};
```

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/) resolves configuration files by looking for workspaces with the name `eslint-config-*`. This lets us write `extends: ['custom']` and have ESLint find our local workspace.

But why is this in the root of the monorepo?

The way ESLint finds its configuration file is by looking at the closest `.eslintrc.js`. If it can't find one in the current directory, it'll look in the directory above until it finds one.

So that means that if we're working on code inside `packages/ui` (which doesn't have a `.eslintrc.js`) it'll refer to the _root_ instead.

Apps that _do_ have an `.eslintrc.js` can refer to `custom` in the same way. For instance, in `docs`:

```ts filename="apps/docs/.eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  root: true,
  extends: ["custom"],
};
```

Just like `tsconfig`, `eslint-config-custom` lets us share ESLint configs across our entire monorepo, keeping things consistent no matter what project you're working on.

#### Summary

It's important to understand the dependencies between these workspaces. Let's map them out:

{/* Could be worth a diagram here? */}

- `web` - depends on `ui`, `tsconfig` and `eslint-config-custom`
- `docs` - depends on `ui`, `tsconfig` and `eslint-config-custom`
- `ui` - depends on `tsconfig` and `eslint-config-custom`
- `tsconfig` - no dependencies
- `eslint-config-custom` - no dependencies

Note that **the Turborepo CLI is not responsible for managing these dependencies**. All of the things above are handled by the package manager you chose (`npm`, `pnpm` or `yarn`).

### 3. Understanding `turbo.json`

We now understand our repository and its dependencies. How does Turborepo help?

Turborepo helps by making running tasks simpler and _much_ more efficient.

Let's take a look inside our root `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "lint": "turbo run lint"
  }
}
```

We've got three tasks specified here in `scripts` which use `turbo run`. You'll notice that each of them is specified in `turbo.json`:

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      //   ^^^^^
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      //   ^^^^
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      //   ^^^
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

What we're seeing here is that we've _registered_ three tasks with `turbo` - `lint`, `dev` and `build`. Every task that's registered inside `turbo.json` can be run with `turbo run <task>`.

To see this in action, let's add a script to the root `package.json`:

```diff filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "turbo run build",
    "dev": "turbo run dev",
    "lint": "turbo run lint",
+   "hello": "turbo run hello"
  }
}
```

Now, let's run `hello`.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run hello
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn hello
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm run hello
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll see this error in the console:

```
task `hello` not found in turbo `pipeline` in "turbo.json".
Are you sure you added it?
```

That's worth remembering - **in order for `turbo` to run a task, it must be in `turbo.json`**.

Let's investigate the scripts we already have in place.

### 4. Linting with Turborepo

Try running our `lint` script:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run lint
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn lint
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm run lint
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll notice several things happen in the terminal.

1. Several scripts will be run at the same time, each prefixed with either `docs:lint`, `ui:lint` or `web:lint`.
2. They'll each succeed, and you'll see `3 successful` in the terminal.
3. You'll also see `0 cached, 3 total`. We'll cover what this means later.

The scripts that each run come from each workspace's `package.json`. Each workspace can optionally specify its own `lint` script:

```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

```json filename="apps/docs/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

```json filename="packages/ui/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint *.ts*"
  }
}
```

When we run `turbo run lint`, Turborepo looks at each `lint` script in each workspace and runs it. For more details, see our [pipelines](/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/running-tasks#defining-a-pipeline) docs.

#### Using the cache

Let's run our `lint` script one more time. You'll notice a few new things appear in the terminal:

1. `cache hit, replaying output` appears for `docs:lint`, `web:lint` and `ui:lint`.
2. You'll see `3 cached, 3 total`.
3. The total runtime should be under `100ms`, and `>>> FULL TURBO` appears.

Something interesting just happened. Turborepo realised that **our code hadn't changed since the last time we ran the lint script**.

It had saved the logs from the previous run, so it just replayed them.

Let's try changing some code to see what happens. Make a change to a file inside `apps/docs`:

```diff filename="apps/docs/pages/index.tsx"
import { Button } from "ui";

export default function Docs() {
  return (
    <div>
-     <h1>Docs</h1>
+     <h1>My great docs</h1>
      <Button />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Now, run the `lint` script again. You'll notice that:

1. `docs:lint` has a comment saying `cache miss, executing`. This means that `docs` is running its linting.
2. `2 cached, 3 total` appears at the bottom.

This means that **the results of our previous tasks were still cached**. Only the `lint` script inside `docs` actually ran - again, speeding things up. To learn more, check out our [caching docs](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching).

### 5. Building with Turborepo

Let's try running our `build` script:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run build
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn build
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm run build
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll see similar outputs to when we ran our lint script. Only `apps/docs` and `apps/web` specify a `build` script in their `package.json`, so only those are run.

Take a look inside `build` in `turbo.json`. There's some interesting config there.

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "outputs": [".next/**"]
    }
  }
}
```

You'll notice that some `outputs` have been specified. Declaring outputs will mean that when `turbo` finishes running your task, it'll save the output you specify in its cache.

Both `apps/docs` and `apps/web` are Next.js apps, and they output builds to the `./.next` folder.

Let's try something. Delete the `apps/docs/.next` build folder.

Run the `build` script again. You'll notice:

1. We hit `FULL TURBO` - the builds complete in under `100ms`.
2. The `.next` folder re-appears!

Turborepo cached the result of our previous build. When we ran the `build` command again, it restored the entire `.next/**` folder from the cache. To learn more, check out our docs on [cache outputs](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching#configuring-cache-outputs).

### 6. Running dev scripts

Let's now try running `dev`.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn dev
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm run dev
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll notice some information in the terminal:

1. Only two scripts will execute - `docs:dev` and `web:dev`. These are the only two workspaces which specify `dev`.
2. Both `dev` scripts are run simultaneously, starting your Next.js apps on ports `3000` and `3001`.
3. In the terminal, you'll see `cache bypass, force executing`.

Try quitting out of the script, and re-running it. You'll notice we don't go `FULL TURBO`. Why is that?

Take a look at `turbo.json`:

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false,
      "persistent": true
    }
  }
}
```

Inside `dev`, we've specified `"cache": false`. This means we're telling Turborepo _not_ to cache the
results of the `dev` script. `dev` runs a persistent dev server and produces no outputs, so there
is nothing to cache. Learn more about in our docs on [turning off caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/caching#turn-off-caching).
Additionally, we set `"persistent": true`, to let turbo know that this is a long-running dev server,
so that turbo can ensure that no other tasks depend on it. You can read more in the [docs for the
`persistent` option](/repo/docs/reference/configuration#persistent).

#### Running `dev` on only one workspace at a time

By default, `turbo run dev` will run `dev` on all workspaces at once. But sometimes, we might only want to choose one workspace.

To handle this, we can add a `--filter` flag to our command. This `--filter` gets passed to the `turbo` CLI.

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    npm run dev -- --filter docs
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    yarn dev --filter docs
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```sh
    pnpm run dev --filter docs
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

You'll notice that it now only runs `docs:dev`. Learn more about [filtering workspaces](/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/filtering) from our docs.
