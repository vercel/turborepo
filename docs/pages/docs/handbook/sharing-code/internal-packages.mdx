# Internal Packages

Internal packages are [packages](/docs/handbook/sharing-code/basics) which are only intended to be used _inside_ your monorepo. They're extremely useful for sharing code between apps in closed-source repositories.

Internal packages are quick to create, and can be turned into [external packages](/docs/handbook/publishing-packages/basics) if you end up wanting to publish them to `npm`.

## What makes a package _internal?_

External packages **run their files through a bundler** before putting them on a package registry. This means they need a _lot_ of tooling to handle.

- **Bundlers**: to build the package
- **Versioning**: to help with versioning and releases
- **Publishing**: to publish the package

If you want to use those files locally, you'll also need:

- **Dev scripts**: for bundling the package locally when files change

Because internal packages are not published, we can skip _all_ of these steps. Instead of bundling our package ourselves, we're going to make the **app which imports the package bundle it for us**.

This sounds complex, but it's extremely easy to set up.

## Our first internal package

We're going to create a shared `math-helpers` package inside our monorepo.

### 1. Create your monorepo

If you don't have an existing monorepo, create one [using our guide](/docs/getting-started/create-new).

### 2. Create a new package

Inside `/packages`, create a new folder called `math-helpers`.

```bash
mkdir packages/math-helpers
```

Create a `package.json`:

```json filename="packages/math-helpers/package.json"
{
  "name": "math-helpers",
  "dependencies": {
    // Use whatever version of TypeScript you're using
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

Create a `src` folder, and add a TypeScript file at `packages/math-helpers/src/index.ts`.

```ts filename="packages/math-helpers/src/index.ts"
export const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};

export const subtract = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a - b;
};
```

You'll also need to add a `tsconfig.json` at `packages/math-helpers/tsconfig.json`:

```json filename="packages/math-helpers/tsconfig.json"
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "preserveWatchOutput": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": true,
    "strict": true
  },
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

Great! We've now got all the files we need for our internal package.

### 3. Import the package

We're now going to import the package and see what happens. Go into one of your apps, and add `math-helpers` into the dependencies of its package.json:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
```jsonc filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "math-helpers": "*"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```jsonc filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "math-helpers": "*"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```jsonc filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "math-helpers": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

[Install all packages from root](/docs/handbook/package-installation) to ensure that dependency works.

Now add an import from `math-helpers` into one of your app's source files:

```diff
+ import { add } from "math-helpers";

+ add(1, 2);
```

You'll likely see an error!

```
Cannot find module 'math-helpers' or its corresponding type declarations.
```

That's because we've missed a step. We haven't told our `math-helpers/package.json` what the entry point to our package is.

### 4. Fix `main` and `types`

Go back to `packages/math-helpers/package.json` and add two fields, `main` and `types`:

```json filename="packages/math-helpers/package.json"
{
  "name": "math-helpers",
  "main": "src/index.ts",
  "types": "src/index.ts",
  "dependencies": {
    "typescript": "latest"
  }
}
```

Now, anything that imports our `math-helpers` module will be pointed directly towards the `src/index.ts` file - _that's_ the file that they will import.

Go back to `apps/web/pages/index.tsx`. The error should be gone!

### 5. Try running the app

Now, try running that app's dev script. In the default turborepo, this will be as easy as:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
```bash
npm run dev
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
yarn dev
```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
```bash
pnpm run dev
```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Vite','Remix']} storageKey="selected-framework">
  <Tab>

When it starts running, you'll likely see an error in your web browser:

```
../../packages/math-helpers/src/index.ts
Module parse failed: Unexpected token (1:21)
You may need an appropriate loader to handle this file type,
currently no loaders are configured to process this file.
See https://webpack.js.org/concepts#loaders

> export const add = (a: number, b: number) => {
|   return a + b;
| };
```

This is what happens when you try and import an un-bundled file into a Next.js app.

The fix is simple - we need to tell Next.js to bundle the files from certain packages it imports.

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Because `vite` transpiles modules by default, there's no more setup needed! Skip to step 7.
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

When you run the app, you'll likely see an error like this:

```
SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'
```

This is what happens when you try and import an un-bundled file into a Remix app.

The fix is simple - we need to tell Remix to bundle the files from certain packages it imports.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 6. Configuring your app

<Tabs items={['Next.js', 'Vite', "Remix"]} storageKey="selected-framework">
  <Tab>

    We can do that using [`next-transpile-modules`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-transpile-modules).

    Install `next-transpile-modules` to your app. For a refresher, see our [package installation](/docs/handbook/package-installation) docs.

    Inside your app's `next.config.js`, add `next-transpile-modules`:

    ```ts filename="apps/web/next.config.js"
    const withTM = require("next-transpile-modules")([
      // Add "math-helpers" to this array:
      "math-helpers",
    ]);

    module.exports = withTM({
      // Any additional config for next goes in here
    });
    ```

    Restart your dev script, and go to the browser.

    **The error has disappeared!**

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    No configuration is needed!
  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    We can do that using `"math-helpers"` to our `serverDependenciesToBundle` inside our `remix.config.js`:

```js filename="apps/remix/remix.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...other config
  serverDependenciesToBundle: ["math-helpers"],
};
```

    Restart your dev script, and go to the browser.

    **The error has disappeared!**

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 7. Summary

We are now able to add any amount of code into our `math-helpers` package, and use it in any app in our monorepo. We don't even need to build our package - it just works.

This pattern is extremely powerful for creating pieces of code that can be easily shared between teams.

#### Quick reference - creating a new internal package

1. Create a new folder in `packages/<folder>`
1. Add a `package.json`, with `name` and `types` pointing at `src/index.ts` (or `src/index.tsx`).
1. Add `src/index.tsx`, with at least one named export.
1. [Install your packages](/docs/handbook/package-installation) from root

#### Quick reference - importing an internal package

1. Ensure that you're [importing it correctly](/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages/#3-import-the-package)
2. Ensure that you've [configured your app to transpile it](/docs/handbook/sharing-code/internal-packages/#6-configuring-your-app)
