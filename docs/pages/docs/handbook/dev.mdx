# Development tasks in a Monorepo

The vast majority of development workflows look like this:

1. Open a repository
2. Run a `dev` task while they develop
3. At the end of the day, shut down the `dev` task and close the repository.

`dev` will likely be the most frequently run task in your repository, so getting it right is important.

## Types of `dev` tasks

`dev` tasks come in many shapes and sizes:

1. Running a local development server for a web app
1. Running [`nodemon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) to re-run a backend process every time code changes
1. Running tests in `--watch` mode

## Setup with Turborepo

You should specify your `dev` task like this in your `turbo.json`.

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

Since `dev` tasks don't produce outputs, `outputs` is empty. `dev` tasks are also unique in that you rarely want to [cache](/docs/core-concepts/caching) them, so we set `cache` as `false`.

### Setting up `package.json`

You should also provide a `dev` task in your root `package.json`:

```json filename="package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "turbo run dev"
  }
}
```

This enables developers to run the task directly from their normal task runner.

## Running tasks _before_ `dev`

In some workflows, you'll want to run tasks _before_ you run your `dev` task. For instance, generating code or running a `db:migrate` task.

In these cases, use [`dependsOn`](/docs/core-concepts/running-tasks#in-the-same-workspace) to say that any `codegen` or `db:migrate` tasks should be run _before_ `dev` is run.

```json filename="turbo.json"
{
  "pipeline": {
    "dev": {
      "dependsOn": ["codegen", "db:migrate"],
      "cache": false,
    },
    "codegen": {
      "outputs": ["./codegen-outputs/**"]
    },
    "db:migrate": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

Then, in your app's `package.json`:

```json filename="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "scripts": {
    // For example, starting the Next.js dev server
    "dev": "next",
    // For example, running a custom code generation task
    "codegen": "node ./my-codegen-script.js",
    // For example, using Prisma
    "db:migrate": "prisma db push"
  }
}
```

This means that users of your `dev` task _don't need to worry about codegen or migrating their database_ - it gets handled for them before their development server even starts.

## Running `dev` only in certain workspaces

To run a `dev` task in only certain workspaces, you should use the [`--filter` syntax](/docs/core-concepts/filtering). For example:

```bash
turbo run dev --filter docs
```

Will only run `dev` in the workspace named `docs`.

## Using environment variables

While developing, you'll often need to use environment variables. These let you customize the behavior of your program - for instance, pointing to a different `DATABASE_URL` in development and production.

We recommend using a library called [`dotenv-cli`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli) to solve this problem.

### Tutorial

1. Install `dotenv-cli` in your [root workspace](/docs/handbook/what-is-a-monorepo#the-root-workspace):

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Installs dotenv-cli in the root workspace
    npm add dotenv-cli
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Installs dotenv-cli in the root workspace
    yarn add dotenv-cli --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    # Installs dotenv-cli in the root workspace
    pnpm add dotenv-cli --ignore-workspace-root-check
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. Add a `.env` file to your root workspace:

```diff
  ├── apps/
  ├── packages/
+ ├── .env
  ├── package.json
  └── turbo.json
```

Add any environment variables you need to inject:

```txt filename=".env"
DATABASE_URL=my-database-url
```

3. Inside your root `package.json`, add a `dev` script. Prefix it with `dotenv`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "dotenv turbo run dev"
  }
}
```

This will extract the environment variables from `.env` before running `turbo run dev`.

4. Now, you can run your dev script:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']} storageKey="selected-pkg-manager">
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

And your environment variables will be populated! In Node.js, these are available on `process.env.DATABASE_URL`.

<Callout>
  You should also [add your environment variables](/docs/core-concepts/caching#altering-caching-based-on-environment-variables) to your `turbo.json` if you're using them to build your app.
</Callout>
