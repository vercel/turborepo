# Remote Caching

A major key to Turborepo's speed is that it is both lazy and efficient—it does the least amount of work possible and it tries to never redo work that's already been done before.

By default, Turborepo caches the outputs of your tasks on your machine's local file system. We call this "single-player mode." But what if you could take advantage of the computational work done by your teammates or your CI by sharing a single cache across machines? In other words, what if you could turn on "co-op multiplayer mode", or a "Dropbox" for your Turborepo cache?

> Remote Caching has entered the chat.

Turborepo can use a technique known as Remote Caching to share cache artifacts across machines for an additional speed boost. This is possible because Turborepo uses content addressable storage.

<Callout>
  Remote Caching is a powerful feature of Turborepo, but with great power comes great responsibility. Make sure you are caching correctly first and double check handling of environment variables. Please also remember Turborepo treats logs as artifacts, so be aware of what you are printing to the console.

## Vercel

### For Local Development

If you want to link your local turborepo to your Remote Cache, first authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your Vercel account:

```sh
npx turbo login
```

Next, link your Turborepo to your remote cache:

```
npx turbo link
```

Once enabled, make some changes to a workspace you are currently caching and run tasks against it with `turbo run`.
Your cache artifacts will now be stored locally _and_ in your Remote Cache.

To verify, delete your local Turborepo cache with:

```sh
rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/turbo
```

Then run the same build again. If things are working properly, `turbo` should not execute tasks locally, but rather download both the logs and artifacts from your Remote Cache and replay them back to you.

### Remote Caching on Vercel Builds

If you are building and hosting your apps on Vercel, Remote Caching will be automatically set up on your behalf once you use `turbo`. You need to update your [build settings](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/deployments/configure-a-build) to build with `turbo`.

Please refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/monorepos#turborepo?utm_source=turborepo.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link) for instructions.

### Artifact Integrity and Authenticity Verification

You can enable Turborepo to sign artifacts with a secret key before uploading them to the Remote Cache. Turborepo uses `HMAC-SHA256` signatures on artifacts using a secret key you provide.
Turborepo will verify the remote cache artifacts' integrity and authenticity when they're downloaded.
Any artifacts that fail to verify will be ignored and treated as a cache miss by Turborepo.

To enable this feature, set the `remoteCache` options on your `turbo.json` config to include `signature: true`. Then specify your secret key by declaring the `TURBO_REMOTE_CACHE_SIGNATURE_KEY` environment variable.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "remoteCache": {
    // Indicates if signature verification is enabled.
    "signature": true
  }
}
```

## Custom Remote Caches

You can self-host your own Remote Cache or use other remote caching service providers as long as they comply with Turborepo's Remote Caching Server API.

You can set the remote caching domain by specifying the `--api` and `--token` flags, where `--api` is the hostname and `--token` is a bearer token.

```sh
turbo run build --api="https://my-server.example.com" --token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

You can see the endpoints / requests [needed here](https://github.com/vercel/turborepo/blob/main/cli/internal/client/client.go).
