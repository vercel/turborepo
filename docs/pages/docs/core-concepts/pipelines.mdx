# Pipelining Package Tasks

In traditional monorepo task runners, like `lerna` or even `yarn`'s own built-in `workspaces run` command, each npm lifecycle script like `build` or `test` is run [topologically](../glossary#topological-order) (which is the mathematical term for "dependency-first" order) or in parallel individually. Depending on the dependency graph of the monorepo, CPU cores might be left idle—wasting valuable time and resources.

Turborepo gives developers a way to specify task relationships explicitly and conventionally. The advantage here is twofold:

1. `turbo` can use this explicit declaration to perform an optimized and scheduled execution based on the abundant availability of multi-core processors.
1. New developers to a project can look at the Turborepo `pipeline` and understand how tasks are related.

To give you a sense of how powerful this can be, the diagram below compares the `turbo` and `lerna` task execution timelines:

![Turborepo vs. Lerna Task Execution](/images/docs/turbo-vs-lerna-execution.png)

Notice that `turbo` is able to schedule tasks efficiently--collapsing waterfalls--whereas `lerna` can only execute one task a time. The results speak for themselves.

## Defining a `pipeline`

To define your monorepo's task dependency graph, use the [`pipeline`](../reference/configuration#pipeline) key in the `turbo.json` configuration file at the root of your monorepo. `turbo` interprets this configuration to schedule, execute, and cache the outputs of the tasks in your monorepo.

Each key in the [`pipeline`](../reference/configuration#pipeline) object is the name of a task that `turbo` will be able to execute using [`turbo run <task>`](../reference/command-line-reference#turbo-run-task1-task2-1). Each task can also be configured to specify dependencies (with the [`dependsOn`](../reference/configuration#dependson) key) as well as other options for [caching](./caching). Workspaces that do not have this task defined in their `package.json`'s list of `scripts` will be ignored during `turbo run`.

An example Pipeline configuration in `turbo.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": [],
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "deploy": {
      "dependsOn": ["build", "test", "lint"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

The rough execution order for a given package based on the `dependsOn` keys above will be:

1. `build` once its dependencies have run their `build` commands
2. `test` once its _own_ `build` command is finished
3. `lint` whenever
4. `deploy` once its _own_ `build`, `test`, and `lint` commands have finished

The full pipeline can then be run:

```bash
npx turbo run deploy
```

Turborepo will then efficiently schedule execution minimizing idle CPUs.

## Task Dependency Format

The `pipeline` conifguration declares the dependency graph of the tasks in your monorepo. In plain English, the example above translates to:

```diff
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
+      // A package's `build` task depends on that package's
+      // topological dependencies' and devDependencies'
+      // `build` tasks  being completed first. The `^` symbol
+      // indicates an upstream dependency.
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
+      // A package's `test` task depends on that package's
+      // own `build` task being completed first.
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": [],
+      // A package's `test` task should only be rerun when
+      // either a `.tsx` or `.ts` file has changed.
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.tsx"]
    },
    "lint": {
+      // A package's `lint` task has no dependencies and
+      // can be run whenever.
      "outputs": []
    },
    "deploy": {
+      // A package's `deploy` task depends on the `build`,
+      // `test`, and `lint` tasks of the same package
+      // being completed.
      "dependsOn": ["build", "test", "lint"],
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Topological Dependency

The `^` symbol explicitly declares that the task has a [package-topological](../glossary#topological-order-1) dependency on another task.

A common pattern in TypeScript monorepos, for example, is to declare that a package's `build` task (e.g. `tsc`) should only run once the `build` tasks of all of its dependencies in the monorepo have run their own `build` tasks. This type of relationship can be expressed as follows:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      // "A package's `build` command depends on its dependencies'
      // and devDependencies' `build` commands being completed first"
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    }
    // ... omitted for brevity
  }
}
```

### Empty Dependency List

An empty dependency list (`dependsOn` is either undefined or `[]`) means that a task can start executing whenever it can! After all, it has NO dependencies.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // ... omitted for brevity

    "lint": {
      // A package's `lint` command has no dependencies and can be run at
      // whenever.
      "outputs": []
    }
  }
}
```

### Restricting Inputs to a Task

A package is considered to have been updated when any of the files in that package have changed.
However, for some tasks, we only want to rerun that task when relevant files have changed.
Specifying `inputs` lets us define which files are relevant for a particular task. For example, the
`test` configuration below declares that the `test` task only needs to execute if a `.tsx` or `.ts` file
in the `src/` and `test/` subdirectories has changed since the last execution.

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // ... omitted for brevity

   "test": {
      // A package's `test` task depends on that package's
      // own `build` task being completed first.
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "outputs": [],
      // A package's `test` task should only be rerun when
      // either a `.tsx` or `.ts` file has changed.
      "inputs": ["src/**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.ts", "test/**/*.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Tasks that are in the `pipeline` but not in SOME `package.json`

Sometimes tasks declared in the `pipeline` are not present in all packages' `package.json` files. `turbo` will gracefully ignore those. No problem!

### `pipeline` tasks are the only ones that `turbo` knows about

`turbo` will only account for tasks declared in the `pipeline` configuration. If it's not listed there, `turbo` will not know how to run them.

### Implicit Dependencies and Specific Package Tasks

Sometimes, you may want to create a package-task dependency on another package-task. This can be especially helpful for repos migrating from `lerna` or `rush`, where tasks are run in separate phases by default. Sometimes these configurations make assumptions that cannot be expressed in a simple `pipeline` configuration, as seen above. Or you may just want to express sequences of tasks between applications or microservices when using `turbo` in CI/CD.

For these cases, you can express these relationships in your `pipeline` configuration using the `<package>#<task>` syntax.
The example below describes the `deploy` script of a `frontend` application that depends on the `deploy` and `health-check` scripts of `backend`, as well as the `test` script of a `ui` package:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    // Standard configuration
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [],
    },
    "deploy": {
      "dependsOn": ["test", "build"],
      "outputs": []
    },

    // Explicit package-task to package-task dependency
    "frontend#deploy": {
      "dependsOn": ["ui#test", "backend#deploy", "backend#health-check"],
      "outputs": []
    },
  }
}
```

This explicit configuration for `frontend#deploy` may seem to conflict with the `test` and `deploy` task configurations, but it does not. Since `test` and `deploy` do not have topological dependencies (e.g. `^<task>`), they can execute any time after their package's `build` and `test` scripts have finished.

<Callout>
  Notes:

1. Although this `<package>#<task>` syntax is a useful escape hatch, we generally recommend using it for deployment orchestration tasks such as health checks, rather than build-time dependencies, so that Turbo can optimize these tasks more efficiently
1. Package-tasks do not inherit cache configuration. You must redeclare
   [`outputs`](../reference/configuration#outputs) at the moment.

</Callout>

### Running tasks defined in the monorepo's root `package.json` file

`turbo` can run tasks that exist in the `package.json` file at the root of the monorepo.
These must be explicitly added to the pipeline configuration using the key syntax `"//#<task>"`. This is
true even for tasks that already have their own entry. For example, if your pipeline declares a `"build"` task,
and you want to include the `build` script defined in the monorepo's root `package.json` file with
`turbo run build`, you must opt the root into it by declaring `"//#build": {...}` in your configuration.
Conversely, you _do not_ need to define a generic `"my-task": {...}` entry if all you need is `"//#my-task": {...}`.

A sample pipeline that defines the root task `format` and opts the root into `test` might look like:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "test": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": [],
    },
    // This will cause the "test" script to be included when
    // "turbo run test" is run
    "//#test": {
      "dependsOn": [],
      "outputs": []
    },
    // This will cause the "format" script in the root package.json
    // to be run when "turbo run format" is run. Since the general
    // "format" task is not defined, only the root's "format" script
    // will be run.
    "//#format": {
      "dependsOn": [],
      "outputs": ["dist/**/*"],
      "inputs": ["version.txt"]
    },
  }
}
```

**A note on recursion**: Scripts defined in the monorepo's root `package.json` often call `turbo` themselves.
For example, the `build` script might be `turbo run build`. In this situation, including `//#build` in
`turbo run build` will cause infinite recursion. It is for this reason that tasks run from the monorepo's root must
be explicitly opted into via including `//#<task>` in the pipeline configuration. `turbo` includes
some best-effort checking to produce an error in the recursion situations, but it is up to you to to only
opt in those tasks which don't themselves trigger a `turbo` run that would recurse.
