# Getting started with workspaces

Workspaces are a feature implemented by package managers to assist with working on multiple apps and packages in the same codebase.

Turborepo is compatible with three package managers ([npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces#description), [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/workspaces)), each with its own implementation of workspaces and functionality. Your package manager will determine how your apps and packages are organized in your workspaces and run in your turborepo.

## Configuring workspaces

To use workspaces, you must first declare their file system locations to your package manager.

A common convention we recommend is having top-level `apps/` and `packages/` directories. This isn't a requirement but just a suggested directory structure. The `apps` folder can contain workspaces for launchable apps, such as a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app. The `packages` folder can contain workspaces for packages used by either an app or another package.

<Callout>
Unlike a single-package repository, you'll need to consider how to name your workspaces. If you avoid `npm` naming collisions, you can use an npm organization or user scope to namespace your workspaces. For example, you might set the `name` key in `./apps/api/package.json` to `@mycompany/api`.

    Add the folders you want to configure as workspaces to the `workspaces` field in your root `package.json` file. This field contains a list of workspace folders in the form of globs:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "monorepo",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "workspaces": [
        "docs",
        "apps/*",
        "packages/*"
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

    Add the folders you want to configure as workspaces to the `workspaces` field in the root `package.json` file. This field contains a list of workspace folders in the form of globs:

    ```json
    {
      "name": "monorepo",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "workspaces": [
        "docs",
        "apps/*",
        "packages/*"
      ]
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    Add the folders you want to configure as workspaces to the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file that exists in your root directory. This file contains a list of workspace folders in the form of globs:

    ```yaml
    packages:
      - "docs"
      - "apps/*"
      - "packages/*"
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

```
monorepo/
├─ docs/
├─ apps/
│  ├─ api/
│  ├─ mobile/
├─ packages/
│  ├─ tsconfig/
│  ├─ config/
├─ sdk/
```

In the example above, all directories inside `monorepo/apps/` and `monorepo/packages/` are workspaces, and the `monorepo/docs` directory itself is also a workspace. `monorepo/sdk/` is _not_ a workspace, as it is not included in the workspace configuration.

## Managing workspaces

When you move, delete, or rename your workspaces, you must ensure that all folders linked within your `package.json` should match. Anytime you change your workspace configuration, provide all the dependencies of the workspace that are updated. Re-run your package manager's install command to check your configuration. If there are problems after that, you may have to delete your `node_modules` folder and re-run an install.

## Managing dependencies

To manage dependencies within workspaces in your monorepo, ensure you are running commands from within the target workspace, or by specifying the workspace when running from root:
