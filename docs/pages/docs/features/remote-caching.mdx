# Remote Caching

A major key 🔑 to Turborepo's speed is that it is both lazy and efficient—it does the least amount of work possible and it tries to never redo work that's already been done before.

At the moment, your Turborepo caches your tasks on your local filesystem (i.e. "single-player mode," if you will). However, what if there was a way to take advantage of the computational work done by your teammates or your CI (i.e. "co-op multiplayer mode")?

What if there was a way to teleport and share a single cache across machines? Almost like a "Dropbox" for your Turborepo cache.

Turborepo can use a technique known as Remote Caching to share cache artifacts across machines for an additional speed boost. This is possible because Turborepo uses content addressable storage.

<Callout type="error"> 
  Remote Caching is an incredibly powerful feature of Turborepo but also a breathtakingly ["sharp knife"](https://m.signalvnoise.com/provide-sharp-knives/) that you can easily cut yourself with. Make sure that your are properly caching things correctly first and double check that you are properly handling environment variables. Please also remember that Turborepo treats logs as artifacts, so be aware of what you are printing to the console.

## Vercel

### For Local Development

Install the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli?utm_source=turborepo.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link) and login to your Vercel account.

```sh
npx vercel login
```

Link your Turborepo to your Vercel account or organization. Your Remote Cache will be shared across all of your organization's projects.

```sh
npx turbo link
```

Once enabled, make some changes to a package or application you are currently caching and run tasks against it with `turbo run`.
Your cache artifacts will now be stored locally _and_ in your Remote Cache.

To verify, delete your local Turborepo cache with:

```sh
rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache/turbo
```

Then run the same build again. If things are working properly, `turbo` should not execute tasks locally, but rather download both the logs and artifacts from your Remote Cache and replay them back to you.

### Remote Caching on Vercel Builds

If you are building and hosting your apps on Vercel, then Remote Caching will be automatically setup for you on your behalf once you use `turbo`. You just need to update your build settings to build with `turbo`.

Please refer to the [Vercel documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git/monorepos#turborepo?utm_source=turborepo.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs-link) for instructions.

## Custom Remote Caches

You can self-host your own Remote Cache or use other remote caching service providers as long as they comply with Turborepo's Remote Caching Server API.

You can set / control the remote caching domain by specifying the `--api` and `--token` flags, where `--api` is the hostname and `--token` is a bearer token.

```sh
turbo run build --api="https://my-server.example.com" --token="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

You can see the endpoints / requests [needed here](https://github.com/vercel/titan/blob/main/internal/client/client.go).
