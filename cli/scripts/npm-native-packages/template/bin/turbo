// Unfortunately even though npm shims "bin" commands on Windows with auto-
// generated forwarding scripts, it doesn't strip the ".exe" from the file name
// first. So it's possible to publish executables via npm on all platforms
// except Windows. I consider this a npm bug.
//
// My workaround is to add this script as another layer of indirection. It'll
// be slower because node has to boot up just to shell out to the actual exe,
// but Windows is somewhat of a second-class platform to npm so it's the best
// I can do I think.
