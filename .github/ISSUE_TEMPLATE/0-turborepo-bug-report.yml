      description: "Please install the canary version of `turbo` (e.g. `npm install turbo@canary`) to try the canary version of Turborepo. It includes all features and fixes that have not been released to the stable version yet. Some issues may already be fixed in the canary version, so please verify that your issue reproduces before opening a new issue."

      description: |
        A link to a **public** GitHub repository with a minimal reproduction. Ideally, minimal reproductions should be created using [`npx create-turbo@canary -e with-shell-commands`](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples/with-shell-commands) and should include only changes that contribute to the issue. You may also use [`npx create-turbo@canary -e <example-name>`](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/tree/main/examples) to create a reproduction that includes frameworks if you believe your bug requires a framework to reproduce.

        Another way you can help the maintainers is to pinpoint the `canary` version of `turbo` that introduced the issue. Check out our [releases](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/releases), and try to find the first `canary` release that introduced the issue. This will help us narrow down the scope of the issue, and possibly point to the PR/code change that introduced it. You can install a specific version of `turbo` by running `npm install turbo@<version>`.

      label: Additional context
      description: |
        Any extra information that might help us investigate. For example, where are you deploying your application (Vercel, Docker, other platform)? Is it only reproducible on that platform, or locally too? Is the issue only happening in a specific browser? etc.
      placeholder: |
        I tested my reproduction against different canary releases, and the first one that introduced the bug was "1.10.4-canary.2", since reverting to "1.10.4-canary.1" works.

        or

        I am using GitHub Actions but running my tasks locally does not have the same issue.
