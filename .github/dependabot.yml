# This file will create many PRs, one for each example.
# From what I can tell, we are forced into approaching it this way
# because of the many workspace roots.

# The GHA at .github/workflows/examples-autoaprove-and-automerge.yml
# is responsible for merging them all to one umbrella PR
# on the branch #dependabot-updates.
