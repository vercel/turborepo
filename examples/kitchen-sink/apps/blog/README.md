# Remix

This directory is a brief example of a [Remix](https://remix.run/docs) site that can be deployed to Vercel with zero configuration.

To get started, run the Remix cli with this template

```sh
npx create-remix@latest --template vercel/vercel/examples/remix
```

## Deploy Your Own

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/vercel/vercel/tree/main/examples/remix&template=remix)

_Live Example: https://remix-run-template.vercel.app_

You can also deploy using the [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli):

```sh
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and you should be ready to go!
