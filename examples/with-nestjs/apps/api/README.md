# With-NestJs | API

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
# Also works with NPM, YARN, BUN, ...
```

By default, your server will run at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You can use your favorite API platform like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to test your APIs

You can start editing the demo **APIs** by modifying [linksService](./src/links/links.service.ts) provider.

### Important Note ðŸš§

If you plan to `build` or `test` the app. Please make sure to build the `packages/*` first.
