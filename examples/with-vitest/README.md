# Turborepo starter

This Turborepo starter is maintained by the Turborepo core team.

## Using this example

This example is based on the `basic` example (`npx create-turbo@latest`) to demonstrate how to use Vitest and get the most out of Turborepo's caching.

For this reason, the only commands in the root package.json are `turbo run test` and `turbo run view-report`.

`turbo run test`: Runs the test in each package using Turborepo.
`turbo run view-report`: Collects coverage from each package and shows it in a merged report.

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
