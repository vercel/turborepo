//! Package manager lockfile parsing, analysis, and serialization
//!
//! Parsing and analysis are used to track which external packages a workspace
//! package depends on. This allows Turborepo to not perform a global
//! invalidation on a lockfile change, but instead only the packages which
//! depend on the changed external packages.
//!
//! Serialization is exclusively used by `turbo prune` and is far more error
//! prone than deserialization and analysis.

/// structure other than being able to uniquely identify a package in the
/// corresponding lockfile. When programming against these keys they should be
/// viewed as a black box and any logic for handling them should live in the
/// specific lockfile implementation which might have additional understanding
/// of them. Using `human_name` can provide a version of the key that is
/// formatted for human viewing. The fact that keys are still represented as
/// `String`s is a vestige of the translation from Go.
///
/// We cannot easily expose lockfiles as a standard
/// graph due to overrides that various lockfile formats support. A dependency
/// of `"package": "1.0.0"` might resolve to a different version depending on
